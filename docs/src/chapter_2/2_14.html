	### 2.14: Moving in Circles

	* **Newtonâ€™s first law of motion:** An object will stay at rest or continue to move at constant velocity unless acted on by a resultant force.

	* Therefore, any object that is not moving in a constant velocity must have a resultant force on it.
	* When an object is moving in a circle, its velocity keeps changing.
	* The resultant force that causes the object to move in a circle is known as **centripetal force**

	> Any centripetal force must continuously change direction so that it is always directed towards the centre of the circle. 

	* Centripetal forces always act perpendicularly to the direction of instantaneous velocity.

	or 

	* When resultant force is perpendicular to the direction of motion, the object follows a circular path.

	##### Examples of centripetal force
	* **Tension** on an object which is spun around on the end of a length of string.
	* **Friction** for people or cars moving on curved roads.
	* **Gravitational forces**for satellites moving around the Earth
	* **Electrical forces** that keep electrons moving around nuclei in atoms.
	* **Magnetic forces** which maintain particle beams in circular paths in nuclear accelerators.

	**Question:** What provides the centripetal force for these athletes running on a curved track? What design features make sure that this force can be large enough for high speeds?

	### 2.14: Moving in Circles

	The resultant force required to keep the object moving in a circle varies with speed and mass of the object, and the radius of the circle.
	* Increasing the speed $\implies$ more force required
	* Increasing radius $\implies$ less force required
	* Increasing mass $\implies$ more force required

	* Many people identify a force acting outwards on them when they go around a circle
	* This force is often called **centrifugal force**.

	> Centrifugal force is *normally thought of* as the tendency of an object moving in a circle to travel away from the center of a circle.

	##### Example of centrifugal force

	A passenger may feel that they are forced outwards against the side door of a car going quickly around a corner. 

	* **From the passenger's perspective:** this is sort of correct
	* **More correct perspective:** the car door is pushing inwards on the passenger, making them move around a corner.

	> Centrifugal force is a *fictitious* force, i.e. it does not really exist.
