	### 3.4: Stretching and Compressing
	* Forces can change the size and shape of a body if the body is **elastic**
	* **Examples:** a spring or a band of rubber stretches with increasing load
	* The **extension** is defined as the change in length of the object being stretched.
	* Load-Extension graphs help us understand how much force on the object causes how much extension.

	### 3.4: Stretching and Compressing
	* For some materials, the load–extension graph is a straight-line graph through the origin. 
	* This means the load is directly proportional to the extension (linear)
	* This means doubling the force, doubles the extension. 
	* Not all load–extension graphs are linear

	### 3.4: Stretching and Compressing

	* For a spring, the graph is linear until a certain point. This point is known as the **limit of proportionality**
	* The point at which the material stop behaving elastically is known as the **elastic limit**
	* **Hooke's Law:** A material is said to obey Hooke's Law if its extension is proportional to the load (below its elastic limit)
	* Springs and metal wires obey Hooke's Law. Rubber bands do not.

	### 3.4: Stretching and Compressing
	* The stiffness of the spring is represented by the slope of the graph.
	* This is called the **spring constant** of the spring.

	> $$ \text{load} = \text{spring constant} \times \text{extension}$$
	> or 
	> $$F = k \times x$$

	**Question:** What is the unit of the spring constant?

	**Workbook, 3.4, 1.b.iii**    
	A force of $3.5\\;N$ increases the lenght of a spring form $0.050\\;m$ to $0.054\\;m$. What is the spring constant?

	**Workbook, 3.4, 1.b.iv**    
	A force of $2.0\\;N$ is applied to a spring of spring constant $45\\;N/m$. By how much does the spring extend?

	**Workbook, 3.4, 1.b.v**    
	A spring of spring constant $26\\;N/m$ extends to a length of $17\\;cm$ when a force of $1.3\\;N$ is applied. What was the original length of the spring?
