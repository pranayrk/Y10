	### 2.8: Friction

	* **Solid friction** is a force which opposes motion between surfaces in contact.
	* The amount of friction between two surfaces depends on:
	* the material of the surfaces 
	* the roughness of the surfaces
	* the normal force acting between them. 
	* In general, frictional forces can be unpredictable.

	### 2.8: Friction

	* Before any movement occurs, the friction force is called **static friction**. 
	* The static frictional force varies up to an upper limit just before motion begins.
	* After motion has started the friction is called **dynamic friction**. 
	* Dynamic friction is independent of speed.
	* Dynamic Friction results in heating. 

	**Important:** Static Friction is greater than dynamic friction.

	### 2.8: Friction

	The elementary property of dynamic friction were discovered by experiment in the 15th-18th centuries and were expressed as three empirical laws:

	* **Amontons' First Law:** The force of friction is directly proportional to the applied load. 
	* **Amontons' Second Law:** The force of friction is independent of the apparent area of contact.
	* **Coulomb's Law of Friction:** Dynamic friction is independent of the sliding velocity.

	**Question:** What is the cause of friction?

	### 2.8: Friction

	* When an object moves through a gas or liquid, there is a friction force opposing the motion. 
	* **In liquid:** this frictional force is called **drag** 
	* **In air:** The frictional force is called **air resistance**.

	<p><b>Question:</b> A person is pushing a $1.0\;kg$ box across a table with a downward diagonal force $F_A = 10\;N$ at an angle of $30^\circ$ as seen below. If the box does not move:
	<ul>
		<li>What is the normal force exerted on the box by the table? </li>
		<li>What is the force opposing the horizontal movement?</li>
	</ul>
