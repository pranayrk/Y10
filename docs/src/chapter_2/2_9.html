	### 2.9 : Force, weight and gravity
	* Any acceleration has to be caused by a **resultant** force.
	* Every objects accelerates towards the earth at $9.8m/s^2$
	* This acceleration due to gravity is also caused by a force: the **gravitational force**
	* All objects exert a gravitational force on each other

	**Question:** What causes the gravitational force? 

	**Answer:** No one knows. Newton described the concept of some force acting upon another at a distance as a "philosophical absurdity". In some ways, his description is accurate even today, since we do not have a proven cause for gravity.

	### 2.9 : Force, weight and gravity

	* **Definition:** **Mass** is a measure of the quantity of matter in an object.
	* **Definition:** **Weight** a gravitational force on an object that has mass

	**Note:** The SI unit of weight is Newton ($N$) since it is a force

	**Important:** Wherever an object is, its mass remains constant.   
	The weight of an object varies on how much gravitational force acts on it.

	> $$ \text{Weight} = \text{mass} \times \text{acceleration due to gravity}$$
	> or
	> $$W = mg$$

	### 2.9 : Force, weight and gravity
	* The force of gravity acts through space and causes an object to fall to the ground.
	* A **field** is a region in space where an object experiences some force.
	* We try to explain gravity by saying that the Earth is surrounded by a gravitational field
	* The **gravitational field strength** is defined as the gravitational force acting per unit mass.
