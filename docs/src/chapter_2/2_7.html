	### 2.7 : Force, mass, acceleration
	* A force is a push or a pull. 
	* It can cause an object at rest to move, or if the body is already moving, it can change its speed or direction of motion.
	* A force can also change a bodyâ€™s shape or size. 
	* For example: a spring or wire will stretch when loaded with a weight.

	### 2.7 : Force, mass, acceleration
	Newton's three laws of motion are three physical laws that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it. 
	* **First Law:** the velocity of a body does not want to change
	* **Second Law:** Gives a mathematical relationship between force, mass and acceleration
	* **Third Law:** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

	Newton's Laws of Motion govern the motion of everything from molecules to planets.

	##### Newton's first law of motion
	> **Statement:** An object stays at rest, or continues to move in a straight line at constant speed, unless acted on by a resultant force.

	All matter has a built-in opposition to any change in its velocity.

	This property of matter is called **inertia**.

	##### Newton's second law of motion
	> $$ \text{Resultant Force} = \text{Mass} \times \text{Acceleration}$$
	> or
	> $$ F = ma$$

	The $1$ Newton is the force required to give a mass of $1$ kilogram an acceleration of $1 \\;m/s^2$.
