	### 2.10: Action and Reaction
	##### Newton's Third Law

	* **Informally:** Newton's third law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. 
	* The *action* and *reaction* refer to forces
	* **Formally:** If Object A exerts a force on Object B, then Object B exerts an equal amount of force on Object A in the opposite direction. 
	> This law represents the fact that all forces occur in pairs. For example, it is not possible to push an object unless it pushes back on you.

	<h5>Newton's Third Law</h5>
	<p> The two forces of a Newtons third law always act on different objects</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> the two forces are always of the same type as each other (e.g. both gravitational or both frictional)</p>

	### Examples of Forces
	##### Non-Contact Forces
	* **Gravitational:** The pull exerted by gravity on any object
	* **Electrostatic:** The attractive or repulsive forces between electric charges
	* **Magnetic:** The attractive or repulsive force between magnets

	### Examples of Forces
	##### Contact Forces
	* **Normal Force:** The push exerted by a surface on an object pressing on it.
	* **Tension:** The pull exerted by a stretched spring, string or rope on an object attached to it.
	* **Compression:** A force that squeezes something together
	* **Friction:** The force that opposes motion between surfaces in contact

	<h3>Different Types of Forces</h3>
	<h5>Normal Force</h5>
	<img height="350" src="images/forces_and_resultants.png"></img>
	<p>The normal force is the force that surfaces exert to prevent solid objects from passing through each other.</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> The normal force is always perpendicular to the surface</p>

	### Different Types of Forces
	##### Normal Force
	**Q.** A $4.5\\;kg$ package of bubble gum is being delivered to the top floor of an office building. 

	The box sits on the floor of an elevator which accelerates upward with an acceleration of magnitude of $3.0\\;m/s^2$. 
	The delivery person is also resting one foot on the package exerting a downward force on the package of magnitude $5\\;N$.

	What is the normal force on the package exerted by the floor of the elevator?
