	### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum
	* **Momentum** can be defined as how much motion is contained in a mass.
	* If an object is moving, then it has momentum.
	* It is a measure of how much "motion" is there within an object.
	* Momentum is a useful quantity to consider when bodies are involved in collisions or explosions.

	##### Difference between force and momentum

	**Force:**

	* Force represents *external* action upon a body, whether a pulling or pushing action. 
	* Force always involves *two bodies*, each applying a force on the other.
	* There cannot be force without an acceleration.

	**Momentum:**
	* Momentum is the representation of the amount of motion within a *single* object.
	* Momentum can exist *without* any acceleration (if the object is at constant velocity)

	> $$ \text{momentum} = \text{mass} \times \text{velocity}$$
	> or  
	> $$p = mv$$

	**Question:** Is momentum a scalar or a vector?  
	**Answer:** Momentum is a vector since it involves velocity

	**Question:** What is the SI unit of momentum?  
	**Answer:** The SI Unit of momentum is $kg \\; m/s$

	##### Newton's Second Law of motion (version 2)

	> * A resultant force causes a body to accelerate.
	> * Any acceleration causes the velocity to change
	> * Any change in velocity causes momentum to change

	* From the above three points, we can conclude that any resultant force causes a change in momentum over time.
	* Newton used this observation to come up with the equation for his second law of motion.

	### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum
	##### Newton's Second Law of motion (version 2)

	> $$ \text{resultant force} = \frac{\text{change in momentum}}{\text{time}}$$
	> or 
	> $$ F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$$

	Newtonâ€™s second law in the form $F = ma$ can only be used with constant masses moving in straight lines. 

	If the mass is changing we need to use the law in the form $F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$

	### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum

	**Question:** Why is $F = ma$ the same as $ F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$?
	$$ 
	\begin{aligned}
	F = ma \implies F & = m \times \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}  \\\\
	\implies F & = m \times \frac{(\text{final velocity} - \text{initial velocity})}{\Delta t} \\\\
	\implies F & = \frac{(m \times \text{final velocity} - m \times \text{initial velocity})}{\Delta t} \\\\
	\implies F & = \frac{(\text{final momentum} - \text{initial momentum})}{\Delta t} \\\\
	\implies F & = \frac{\text{change in momentum}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} \\\\
	\end{aligned}
	$$

	### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum
	The equation $ F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} $ can be rearranged as

	> $$\text{resultant force} \times \text{time} = \text{change in momentum}$$  
	> or
	> $$F \times \Delta t = \Delta p$$
	* The quantity $F \times \Delta t$ is known as **impulse**
	* $F \times \Delta t = \Delta p\\;\\;$ is known as the **impulse-momentum** equation

	**Note:** The SI unit of impulse is $N s$

	### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum
	* $F \times \Delta t = \Delta p$ talks about *how much force over how much time* is required to cause a given change in momentum
	* For example, consider we want to stop a moving car. To get this effect: 
	* We can use the brakes to stop the car quickly. This is a large force applied over a short time
	* We can also let the car slow down naturally by friction. This is a small force applied over a long time.

	**Question:** Why do seatbelts and airbags work?  
	**Answer:** Seatbelts and airbags distribute the impulse over a longer time resulting in less force applied to the person.

	### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum
	* In a closed system, the total momentum before an event is the same as the total momentum after the event

	* More accurately,
	> When two or more bodies act on one another, as in a collision, the total momentum of the bodies remains constant, provided no external forces act on them.

	* This statement is known as the **law of conservation of momentum**
