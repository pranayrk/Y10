	### 2.4 : Free Fall
	* **Acceleration of free fall** is the *constant* downward acceleration applied on an object which makes it fall down
	* This acceleration is represented by the symbol $g$. 
	* On Earth, the acceleration measures to be $9.8m/s^2$. 
	* On the moon, it is $1.62m/s^2$
	* On Jupiter, it is $24.9m/s^2$

	### 2.4 : Free Fall
	**Learners Book, 2.5 Page 2**  
	A ball is thrown upwards with an initial velocity of $30m/s$. Graph the velocity-time graph for the motion till it falls back to the starting point.

	**Extra Question:** How much distance has the ball travelled?

	### 2.4 : Free Fall
	* Without air resistance, gravity causes an acceleration of $9.8m/s^2$. 
	* With air resistance:
	* The object falls and its speed increases
	* The faster an object moves, the more air resistance it faces
	* Eventually air resistance and gravity are equal and opposite 
	* No resultant acceleration, so the speed becomes constant
	* This constant speed is known as the **terminal velocity**

	### 2.4 : Free Fall

	The terminal velocity of a human is around $200km/h$.  
	The terminal velocity of an ant is around $6km/h$.

	The terminal velocity of an object depends on the weight, size and shape:
	* A small dense object has a high terminal velocity
	* A light object with larger area has a low terminal velocity
