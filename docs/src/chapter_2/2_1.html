	### 2.1 : Speed, velocity and acceleration

	**Workbook 2.1, 1.b.i**  
	Calculate the speed of a girl walking if she travels $100m$ in $50s$

	**Workbook 2.1, 1.b.ii**  
	Calculate the average speed of a car that travels $2km$ in $2$ minutes

	**Workbook 2.1, 1.b.iii**  
	An athlete moving at $4.5m/s$ travels a distance of $0.09km$. How long does this take?

	### 2.1 : Speed, velocity and acceleration
	* A *scalar* is a quantity which is the answer to the question "how much"
	* A *vector* is a quantity which answers the questions "how much" + "in which direction"
	* **Displacement** is the distance an object travels in a particular direction. 
	* **Velocity** is the speed an object travels in a particular direction.

	> $\text{Velocity} = \displaystyle\frac{\text{displacement}}{\text{time taken}}$

	<b>Acceleration</b> is a <em>vector</em> that is a measure of the rate of change of velocity

	<p><b>Unit:</b> If time is measured in seconds and velocity in metres per second, acceleration has the unit metres per second squared ($m/s^2$)</p>

	### 2.1 : Speed, velocity and acceleration

	**Workbook 2.2, 1.b**   
	Calculate the acceleration of a cyclist who increases her velocity from $5 m/s$ to $7 m/s$ in $0.5s$

	**Workbook 2.2, 1.c** 

	How long does it take for a train to increase its velocity from $10m/s$ to $40m/s$ if it accelerates at $3 m/s^2$?


	**Workbook 2.2, 1.d**  

	A car, initially travelling at $6 m/s$, accelerates at $4 m/s^2$ for $2.5s$. What is its final velocity?
