The internal energy of a system can change as a result of heat
added or taken out and as a result of work performed.

If 1 kg of water and 1 kg of paraffin are heated in
turn for the same time by the same heater, the
temperature rise of the paraffin is about twice
that of the water. Since the heater gives equal
amounts of thermal energy to each liquid, it
seems that different substances require different
amounts of energy to cause the same temperature
rise in the same mass, say 1°C in 1 kg.
The amount of heat required to raise the
temperature of a particular substance by one
degree is measured by its specific heat capacity
(symbol c).
The specific heat capacity of a substance is
defined as the energy required per unit mass per
unit temperature increase.
In physics, the word ‘specific’ means that unit
mass is being considered.
In general, for a mass m, receiving energy ΔE
which results in a temperature rise Δθ, this can
be written in equation form as
ΔE
mΔθ
where c is the specific heat capacity of a material
of mass m whose temperature rises by Δθ when
its internal energy increases by ΔE.
Internal energy is measured in joules (J) and
the unit of specific heat capacity is the joule per
kilogram per °C, i.e. J/(kg °C).

ΔE = mcΔθ = mass × specific heat capacity ×
temperature rise



The specific heat capacity of water is 4200 J/(kg °C)
and that of soil is about 800 J/(kg °C). As a result,
the temperature of the sea rises and falls more
slowly than that of the land. A certain mass of water
needs five times more energy than the same mass of
soil for its temperature to rise by 1°C. Water also has
to give out more energy to fall 1°C. Since islands are
surrounded by water, they experience much smaller
changes of temperature from summer to winter than
large land masses such as Central Asia.
The high specific heat capacity of water (as
well as its cheapness and availability) accounts for
its use in cooling engines and in the radiators of
central heating systems.



Energy that is transferred to a solid during melting or
given out by a liquid during solidification is called latent
heat of fusion. Latent means hidden and fusion means
melting. Latent heat does not cause a temperature
change; it seems to disappear.The specific latent heat of fusion (lf ) of a substance is
the quantity of heat needed to change unit mass from
solid to liquid without temperature change.
Specific latent heat is measured in J/kg or J/g.
In general, the quantity of heat ΔE needed to change
a mass m from solid to liquid is given by


If we transfer the same amount of thermal energy to the same masses of
different substances, the temperature rises will all be different. Each substance
has a different heat capacity.


If, when thermal energy Q is supplied to a mass m and the temperature rise
is ΔT, the specific heat capacity of the substance can be determined from
Q
c = mΔT. This equation is more commonly written as Q = mcΔT.

It is common for work to be done by resistive forces (such as friction) as the
kinetic energy of an object is reduced and transferred into internal energy, so
that ΔKE = mcΔT.

A similar calculation may be used to determine the possible temperature rise
of substance (e.g. water) falling a known distance: mgΔh = mcΔT.



The energy transfer associated with a change of phase at a constant
temperature is called latent heat. For melting or freezing this is called the
latent heat of fusion. For boiling or condensing this is called the latent
heat of vaporization.

Latent heat has to be supplied in order to melt or boil substances, but equally
important, latent heat is emitted from gases turning to liquids (e.g. steam
condensing), or from liquids freezing.

	* When you boil water for a drink, the more water you heat, the longer it takes to boil. This shows that **the thermal energy needed depends on the mass of water being heated**. 
	* If the water is colder to begin with, it takes longer to boil. This shows that **the thermal energy needed depends on the temperature change**.
	* Water takes a lot of thermal energy to heat up compared with other substances. This is why sand on a beach heats up — and cools down — more quickly than the sea. This shows that **the thermal energy needed depends on the material being heated**.

	**Specific heat capacity** $c$ is defined as the amount of thermal energy required to raise the temperature of a $1\\;kg$ of a substance by $1^\circ C$ (or $1 \\;K$).
	> The definition gives us the equation for specific heat capacity:
	>	$$c = \frac{\Delta E}{m \Delta \theta}$$
	> where $\Delta E =$ thermal energy required (in $J$)  
	> and $\Delta θ =$ temperature change (in K or °C)   
	> $m = $mass of substance (in kg)
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	> The equation can be rearranged as $\Delta E = mc\Delta \theta$.

	* The SI unit of specific heat capacity is
		* joule per kilogram per kelvin, $J/(kg K)$
		* joule per kilogram per degree Celcius, $J/(kg^\circ C)$.
