	<p>The force from one collision is small but as there are many particles colliding all of the time, the force exerted is large.</p>

	* We can observe $p$ is directly proportional to $\frac{1}{V}$ (since the graph is a straight line)
	* So, $p$ is inversely proportional to $V$.
	$$p \propto \frac{1}{V}$$

	* Changing the proportionality to an equality:
	$$ p = \text{constant} \times \frac{1}{V}$$
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	> $$ p \times V = \text{constant}$$

	* If several pairs of readings, $p_1$ and $V_1$, $p_2$ and $V_2$, etc. are taken, then it can be confirmed that

	$$ p_1 V_1 = p_2 V_2 = \text{constant}$$

higher temperature. The higher the temperature of a gas, the faster its particles
are moving. The particles will hit the walls more often and with more force. This

	Kinetic model of matter on gas pressure

	All the particles in a gas are in rapid random
motion, with a wide range of speeds, and repeatedly
hit and rebound from the surfaces of the container
in huge numbers per second.
This causes a pressure on the surfaces of the
container. When the temperature of the gas rises,
so does the average speed and kinetic energy of
the particles. Collisions with the surfaces of the
container occur more frequently and so the pressure
of the gas increases.
</section>
<section>
	Force and gas pressure
At each collision of a gas particle with a surface
of the container, it undergoes a change of
momentum which produces a force on the surface
(see Topic 1.6). At a constant temperature the
average force and hence the pressure exerted on
the surface is constant, since pressure is force
per unit area. When the temperature rises and the
rate at which collisions with the surfaces of the
container increases, so does the average force and
hence the gas pressure.
