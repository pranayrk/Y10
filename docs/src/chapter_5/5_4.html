	<p>The kinetic model can also help us understand why a gas exerts pressure on the walls of its container.</p>

	<p>A gas molecule hits the wall of its container. It applies a force on the container and rebounds away</p>

	<p>This behaviour for an individual atom can be modelled by Newton's laws and the law of conservation of momentum</p>

	<p>Since its is inconvenient to model every atom in a gas, we normally consider the average effect of all these collisions</p>
	<img height="300" src="images/gas_pressure_force.png"></img>
	<p>The force from one collision is small but as there are many particles colliding all of the time, the force exerted is large.</p>

	<p>If that pressure were to be removed from a container, by removing all the gas to form a vacuum, it would crush the container if it is not strong enough</p>
	<img height="300" src="images/collapse_can.png"></img>
	<p>This is because there is nothing inside the container to resist the atmospheric pressure of $1 \times 10^5\\;Pa$</p>

	<p>We setup this experiment to verify this experiment</p>
	<p>It consists of an air pump that can increase the pressure in a container.</p>
	<p>The more the pressure on the container, the higher the oil column will rise</p>
	<p>This reduces the volume in the vertical column</p>
	<p>We can measure the change in volume by measuring the change in height (because the area stays the same)</p>

	<p>The variation of the pressure of a fixed mass of gas with changes in volume (at constant temperature) is shown</p>
	<p>Examination of the curve shows that if <b>$p$ is doubled, $V$ is halved.</b></p>
	<p>The graph is an <b>isothermal</b> graph, which means that the temperature at all points in the graph is kept the same</p>

	* We can observe $p$ is directly proportional to $\frac{1}{V}$ (since the graph is a straight line)
	* So, $p$ is inversely proportional to $V$.
	$$p \propto \frac{1}{V}$$

	* Changing the proportionality to an equality:
	$$ p = \text{constant} \times \frac{1}{V}$$
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	> $$ p \times V = \text{constant}$$

	* If several pairs of readings, $p_1$ and $V_1$, $p_2$ and $V_2$, etc. are taken, then it can be confirmed that

	$$ p_1 V_1 = p_2 V_2 = \text{constant}$$

	> **The pressure of a fixed mass of gas is inversely proportional to its volume if its temperature is kept constant**

	What happens to a gas when it is heated? Consider the same gas at a
higher temperature. The higher the temperature of a gas, the faster its particles
are moving. The particles will hit the walls more often and with more force. This
increases the pressure.

	Kinetic model of matter on gas pressure

	All the particles in a gas are in rapid random
motion, with a wide range of speeds, and repeatedly
hit and rebound from the surfaces of the container
in huge numbers per second.
This causes a pressure on the surfaces of the
container. When the temperature of the gas rises,
so does the average speed and kinetic energy of
the particles. Collisions with the surfaces of the
container occur more frequently and so the pressure
of the gas increases.
</section>
<section>
	Force and gas pressure
At each collision of a gas particle with a surface
of the container, it undergoes a change of
momentum which produces a force on the surface
(see Topic 1.6). At a constant temperature the
average force and hence the pressure exerted on
the surface is constant, since pressure is force
per unit area. When the temperature rises and the
rate at which collisions with the surfaces of the
container increases, so does the average force and
hence the gas pressure.
