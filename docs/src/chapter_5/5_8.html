When a solid is heated, it may melt and change
its state from solid to liquid. If ice is heated it
becomes water. The opposite process, freezing,
occurs when a liquid solidifies.

A pure substance melts at a definite temperature,
called the melting temperature; it solidifies at
the same temperature – sometimes then called the
freezing temperature. At standard atmospheric
pressure, the melting temperature of water is 0°C.


The previous experiment shows that the temperature
of liquid stearic acid falls until it starts to solidify
(at 69°C) and remains constant until it has all
solidified. The cooling curve in Figure 2.2.13 is for a
pure substance; the flat part AB occurs at the melting
temperature when the substance is solidifying.
During solidification a substance transfers thermal
energy to its surroundings but its temperature does
not fall. Conversely when a solid is melting, the
energy supplied does not cause a temperature rise;
energy is transferred but the substance does not
get hotter. For example, the temperature of a well-
stirred ice–water mixture remains at 0°C until all the
ice is melted. Similarly when energy is supplied to a
boiling liquid, the temperature of the liquid does not
change. The temperature of pure water boiling at
standard atmospheric pressure is 100°C.

Evaporation occurs when faster-moving particles
escape from the surface of the liquid. The average
speed and therefore the average kinetic energy
of the particles left behind decreases, i.e. the
temperature of the liquid falls.


Water evaporates from the skin when we sweat. This is
the body’s way of losing unwanted heat and keeping
a constant temperature. After vigorous exercise there
is a risk of the body being overcooled, especially in a
draught; it is then less able to resist infection.
Ether acts as a local anaesthetic by chilling
(as well as cleaning) your arm when you are
having an injection. Refrigerators, freezers and
air-conditioning systems use cooling by evaporation
on a large scale.
Volatile liquids are used in perfumes.
