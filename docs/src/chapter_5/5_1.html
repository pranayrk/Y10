	### 5.1: Moving Particles 
	> The “visible” energies associated with an object would include its kinetic energy store if it is moving, and its gravitational potential energy store if it is lifted above ground level.  
	> **But there is also a deeper, macroscopically-invisible store of energy associated with the particles of which the object is composed.**

	### 5.1: Moving Particles 
	* **Kinetic theory of matter:** matter is made of tiny particles constantly in motion
	* Particles have kinetic energy because they are moving
	* Particles also have potential energy because they oppose the bonds pulling them apart
	* The hotter a material is, the faster the particles move, the more its internal energy

	<p>Potential energy in particles can be considered as the energy that keeps the particles in their positions.</p>

	<p>The more the internal energy, the faster the particles move</p>

	<p>Internal energy is not synonymous with thermal energy; rather, the thermal energy of a system can be taken as being a part of the internal energy of the system.</p>
