	### 5.1: Moving Particles 
	* The **Kinetic theory of matter** says that matter is made of tiny particles constantly in motion
	* Particles have kinetic energy because they are moving or vibrating
		* In solids, particles vibrate about their fixed  positions
		* In liquids, particles vibrate a little and also move around a little
		* In gases, particles move around a lot

	<p>The kinetic theory of matter was first put forward for gases</p>
	<img height="450" src="images/gases_translational.gif"></img>
	<p>In an ideal gas, the molecules only interact with each other in collisions, which are thought to be <b>perfectly elastic</b></p>

	<blockquote>Movement should not be denied based on the fact it is not seen. Who would deny that the leaves of trees move when rustled by a wind, despite it being unobservable from large distances? Just as in this case motion remains hidden due to perspective, it remains hidden in warm bodies due to the extremely small sizes of the moving particles. In both cases, the viewing angle is so small that neither the object nor their movement can be seen.</blockquote>

	### 5.1: Moving particles

	* It can also be used to explain the nature of **heat**
	* The particles of solids and liquids are in constant motion.
	* When heated they vibrate faster, so force each other a little further apart
	* Kinetic theory uses the idea that as particles heat up **they gain more kinetic energy and move faster**.

	<h3>5.1: Moving particles</h3>
	<p>The vibration in particles of a solid or liquid is because the particles have sort of <b>potential energy</b> </p>
	<p>This potential energy between particles help them stay together</p>

	<blockquote>$\text{Internal Energy} = \text{Total Kinetic Energy} + \text{Total Potential Energy}$</blockquote>
	<p>The more the internal energy, the faster the particles move</p>

	### 5.1: Moving particles
	* If the *average internal energy per molecule* in one part of an object is greater than another part, then the energy will spread out until it is evenly distributed.
	* This is known as **thermal interaction** and the movement of energy is known as **thermal energy** or **heat**
	* If the temperature of a substance increases, it is because the *average internal energy* of its molecules has increased.
	* Once all the particles of a substance have the same internal energy, we say it has reached **thermal equilibrium**.
