	### 5.1: Moving Particles 
	* The **Kinetic theory of matter** says that matter is made of tiny particles constantly in motion
	* Particles have kinetic energy because they are moving or vibrating
		* In solids, particles vibrate about their fixed  positions
		* In liquids, particles vibrate a little and also move around a little
		* In gases, particles move around a lot

	<blockquote>Movement should not be denied based on the fact it is not seen. Who would deny that the leaves of trees move when rustled by a wind, despite it being unobservable from large distances? Just as in this case motion remains hidden due to perspective, it remains hidden in warm bodies due to the extremely small sizes of the moving particles. In both cases, the viewing angle is so small that neither the object nor their movement can be seen.</blockquote>

	### 5.1: Moving particles

	The kinetic model of matter can be used to explain many physical properties of matter:

	It can be used to explain why: 
	* Liquids take up the shape of their container
	* Gases fill their container
	* Solids keep their shape
	* Gases diffuse (spread out) from place to place
	* Most solids expand when they melt.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 5.1: Moving particles

	* It can also be used to explain the nature of **heat**
	* The particles of solids and liquids are in constant motion.
	* When heated they vibrate faster, so force each other a little further apart
	* Kinetic theory uses the idea that as particles heat up **they gain more kinetic energy and move faster**. 
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 5.1: Moving particles
	* **Heat** is energy that is transferred from one body to another due to a difference in temperature
	* Heat transfer increases the energy of the colder object by transferring kinetic energy from the hotter object

	##### Celsius Scale
	* The Celsius scale was devised by the Swedish scientist **Anders Celsius**.
	* It has two fixed points:
		* $0^\circ C$: the melting point of pure ice at atmospheric pressure
		* $100^\circ C$: the boiling point of pure water at atmospheric pressure.

	* When a thermometer is used to measure the temperature of a body it
	has to come into contact with the body.
	* A **thermal interaction** takes place and energy is transferred until the thermometer and the body are at the same temperature.
	* When this happens we say that we have **thermal equilibrium.**
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 5.1: Moving Particles
	> As a substance cools down its **particles lose kinetic energy and slow down**. 

	* If the particles lose all their kinetic energy and stop moving, it is not possible for the substance to cool any further.
	* Kinetic theory suggests there is a limit to how low temperatures can go. 
	* The lowest possible temperature is around −273 °C. 
	* This is called **absolute zero**.

	The kinetic model can also help us understand how gases behave. 
	**Why does a gas cause pressure on the walls of its container?**
	<img src="images/gas_in_container.png"></img>
	The particles of a gas move around inside its container, bumping into the sides. 
	The gas causes pressure on the walls of the container because the gas particles are constantly colliding with the walls.

	What happens to a gas when it is heated? Consider the same gas at a
higher temperature. The higher the temperature of a gas, the faster its particles
are moving. The particles will hit the walls more often and with more force. This
increases the pressure.

	The constant collision of air particles on the walls of the container exerts a pressure on the container.
	The force from one collision is small but as there are many particles colliding all of the time, the force
exerted is large.

	Kinetic model of matter on gas pressure

	All the particles in a gas are in rapid random
motion, with a wide range of speeds, and repeatedly
hit and rebound from the surfaces of the container
in huge numbers per second.
This causes a pressure on the surfaces of the
container. When the temperature of the gas rises,
so does the average speed and kinetic energy of
the particles. Collisions with the surfaces of the
container occur more frequently and so the pressure
of the gas increases.
</section>
<section>
	Force and gas pressure
At each collision of a gas particle with a surface
of the container, it undergoes a change of
momentum which produces a force on the surface
(see Topic 1.6). At a constant temperature the
average force and hence the pressure exerted on
the surface is constant, since pressure is force
per unit area. When the temperature rises and the
rate at which collisions with the surfaces of the
container increases, so does the average force and
hence the gas pressure.

	If the average internal energy per molecule in one part of a substance is greater
than another part, then the energy will spread out until it is evenly distributed.
This movement of energy is called thermal energy
In everyday conversation, we use the idea of temperature as a number which
represents how hot (or cold) something is. But that is not precise enough for a
scientific definition.
We know that thermal energy flows from hotter places to colder places, so we
can also say that temperatures determine the direction of net thermal energy
flow.

Since internal energy spreads out from places where it is more concentrated,
we can make a connection between temperature and the concentration of
energy: if the temperature of a substance increases, it is because the average
internal energy of its molecules has increased.

	The Celsius temperature scale is an arbitrary scale based (for convenience)
only on the melting and boiling points of pure water. It was decided to call
these 0 °C and 100 °C, with one hundred divisions between them. It is
important to realize that 0 °C is not in any sense a true zero of temperature.
The Kelvin temperature scale was designed to overcome this problem. Its units
are kelvin, K. This scale has a true zero (0 K) as the temperature at which
(almost) all molecular motion has stopped (see later). For this reason the
Kelvin temperature scale is also known as the absolute temperature scale,
and 0 K is called absolute zero. On the Celsius scale absolute zero has the value
of −273 °C (more precisely, −273.15 K).

It was decided that each division on the Kelvin (absolute) scale should be
equal to each division on the Celsius scale. This enables easy conversions
between the two scales: temperature (K) = temperature (°C) + 273 (see
Figure 3.2). The symbol T is used to represent temperature, especially
absolute temperature, but it is also common to use θ for temperatures in
degrees Celsius.
Calculations involving only single temperatures should always use the Kelvin
scale, but calculations involving changes of temperature can use the Kelvin or
the Celsius scale.
