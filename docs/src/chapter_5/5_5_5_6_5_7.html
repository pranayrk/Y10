	<li>This experiment can be extended to multiple different materials to compare which materials are good conductors.</li>
	<li>The materials which are good conductors will transmit heat better, and the matches will fall faster.</li>

		<li>The process by which heat is directly transmitted through the material of a substance when there is a difference of temperature is known as <b>thermal conduction</b>.</li>
		<li>Molecules in hotter objects have more kinetic energy and move faster.</li>
		<li>These molecules collide with adjacent molecules, transferring their kinetic energy (lattice vibrations).</li>
		<li>This process continues until the temperature of both objects is the same.</li>

		<li>The composition of a material affects how well it conducts heat.</li>
		<li>Pure metals conduct heat well through the movement of <b>free electrons</b> which are free to travel through the lattice.</li>
		<li>Solids which do not have free electrons conduct heat through lattice vibrations.</li>

		<li>The particles in liquids and gases are spaced further apart than those in solids.</li>
		<li>The collisions between the particles are less frequent in liquids and gases.</li>
		<li>This means that the transfer of kinetic energy from the fast-moving particles to neighbouring particles is slower.</li>
		<li>This explains why <em>liquids and gases are bad thermal conductors</em>.</li>

		<li>Liquids and gases get hotter by convection.</li>
		<li>Convection is the transfer of thermal energy in a fluid (liquid or gas) by means of convection currents due to a difference in density.</li>
	</ul>
	<h6>Convection currents form because of the difference in density in water when
heated. When the water at the bottom of the flask is heated, it expands.
The expanded water is less dense than the surrounding water because there
is more space between the molecules. The warmer, less dense water rises.
It cools down at the top of the flask, become denser and sinks down again.
This process repeats until the whole flask of water is heated up.</h6>

	<p><b>An experiment to demonstrate convection currents in liquids</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Water is a transparent liquid and hence, it is difficult to observe convection currents in pure water.</li>
		<li>We can demonstrate convection currents in water through the help of <b>potassium permanganate</b> crystals, which are purple in colour. These crystals dissolve in the water to form a purple stream.</li>

	<p><b>An experiment to demonstrate convection currents in gases</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Convection currents occur only in fluids (liquids and gases).</li>
		<li>This is because convection involves the <em>bulk movement of the fluid</em> that carries the thermal energy.</li>
		<li>In solids, the particles are in fixed positions and cannot flow.</li>

		<li>Thermal radiation is the transfer of thermal energy in the form of invisible waves called <b>infrared radiation</b>.</li>
		<li>Unlike conduction and convection, infrared radiation can travel through a vacuum. It does not require a medium to travel through.</li>
		<li><em>All objects emit thermal radiation at all times.</em> If objects absorb the same amount of radiation they emit, their temperature remains constant.</li>

	<h5>Factors affecting radiation</h5>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Surface Texture:</b> Dull and black surfaces emit and absorb infrared radiation at a faster rate than shiny and silver surfaces. Shiny and silver surfaces reflect more infrared radiation.</li>
		<li><b>Surface Temperature:</b> The higher the temperature of an object’s surface relative to the surrounding temperature, the higher the rate of emission of infrared radiation.</li>
		<li><b>Surface Area:</b> If we compare two objects of the same mass and material, but with different surface areas, the object
with the larger surface area will emit or absorb infrared radiation at a higher rate.</li>
