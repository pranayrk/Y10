The handle of a metal spoon held in a hot drink
soon gets warm. Heat passes along the spoon by
conduction.
Conduction is the flow of thermal energy (heat)
through matter from places of higher temperature
to places of lower temperature without movement of
the matter as a whole.

Metal objects below body temperature feel colder
than those made of bad conductors – even if all
the objects are at exactly the same temperature –
because they carry thermal energy away faster from
the hand.

Most metals are good conductors of thermal energy;
materials such as wood, glass, cork, plastics and
fabrics are thermal insulators (poor conductors).
The arrangement in Figure 2.3.2 can be used to show
the difference between brass and wood. If the rod is
passed through a flame several times, the paper over
the wood scorches but not the paper over the brass.
The brass conducts the heat away from the paper
quickly, preventing the paper from reaching the
temperature at which it burns. The wood conducts
the thermal energy away only very slowly.

Liquids and gases also conduct thermal energy
but only very slowly. Water is a very poor thermal
conductor, as shown in Figure 2.3.3. The water at the
top of the tube can be boiled before the ice at the
bottom melts.

Two processes occur in metals. Metals have a large
number of ‘free’ (delocalised) electrons (Topic 4.2.2)
which move about within the metal. When one
part of a metal is heated, the electrons there move
faster (their kinetic energy increases) and move
further. As a result, they are able to interact with
particles in cooler parts, so passing on their energy
and raising the temperature of these parts. This
process occurs quickly.
The second process is much slower. The
atoms or molecules at the hot part make colder
neighbouring particles vibrate more vigorously.
These atomic or molecular lattice vibrations are
less important in metals, but are the only way
conduction can occur in non-metals since these
do not have free electrons; hence non-metals are
poor conductors of heat and are good insulators.
There are many solids which have fewer free
electrons available to transfer thermal energy
than metals do and so are less good thermal
conductors than metals but better thermal
conductors than insulators. For example, the
semiconductors used in electronic circuits can
have a range of thermal conductivities between
those of metals and insulators.
Liquids and gases are generally less dense than
solids and their particles are further apart. They
do not have a regularly ordered particle structure,
so it is difficult to set up lattice vibrations, and
they do not usually have free electrons. They
are therefore less good thermal conductors than
solids.

Conduction is the flow of thermal energy (heat)
through matter from places of higher temperature
to places of lower temperature without movement of
the matter as a whole.

Convection is the usual method by which thermal
energy (heat) travels through fluids such as liquids
and gases. It can be shown in water by dropping a
few crystals of potassium permanganate down a tube
to the bottom of a beaker or flask of water. When the
tube is removed and the beaker heated just below
the crystals by a small flame (Figure 2.3.4a), purple
streaks of water rise upwards and fan outwards.

Streams of warm, moving fluids are called
convection currents. They arise when a fluid is
heated because it expands, becomes less dense and
is forced upwards by surrounding cooler, denser fluid
which moves under it. We say ‘hot water (or hot
air) rises’. Warm fluid behaves like a cork released
under water: being less dense it bobs up. Lava lamps
(Figure 2.3.4b) use this principle.

During the day the temperature of the land increases
more quickly than that of the sea (because the
specific heat capacity of the land is much smaller;
see Topic 2.2.2). The hot air above the land rises and
is replaced by colder air from the sea. A breeze from
the sea results (Figure 2.3.6a).
At night the opposite happens. The sea has more
thermal energy to transfer and cools more slowly.
The air above the sea is warmer than that over the
land and a breeze blows from the land (Figure 2.3.6b).


Radiation is a third way in which thermal energy
can travel but, whereas conduction and convection
both need matter to be present, radiation can occur
in a vacuum; particles of matter are not involved.
Radiation is the way thermal energy reaches us from
the Sun.
Radiation has all the properties of
electromagnetic waves (Topic 3.3), and travels with
the speed of light. Thermal radiation is infrared
radiation and all objects emit this radiation. When
it falls on an object, it is partly reflected, partly
transmitted and partly absorbed: the absorbed
radiation raises the temperature of the object.
Buildings in hot countries are often painted
white (Figure 2.3.8). This is because white surfaces
are good reflectors of radiation and so help to keep
the houses cool.

Dull black surfaces are better absorbers of radiation
than white shiny surfaces, which are instead good
reflectors of radiation. Reflectors on electric fires
are made of polished metal because of its good
reflecting properties.

Some surfaces also emit radiation better than others
when they are hot. If you hold the backs of your
hands on either side of a hot copper sheet that
has one side polished and the other side blackened
(Figure 2.3.10), it will be found that your hands feel
warmer near the dull black surface. The dull black
surface is a better emitter of radiation than the
shiny one.
The cooling fins on the heat exchangers at the
back of a refrigerator are painted black so are good
emitters of radiation and they transfer thermal
energy more quickly. By contrast, saucepans that are
polished are poor emitters and keep their heat longer.
In general, surfaces that are good absorbers
of radiation are good emitters when hot.

Uses of conductors
Good conductors
These are used whenever heat is required to travel
quickly through something. Saucepans, boilers and
radiators are made of metals such as aluminium,
iron and copper which are all good conductors that
transfer thermal energy quickly.
Bad conductors (insulators)
The handles of some saucepans are made of wood
or plastic. Cork is used for table mats. These are
insulating materials that transfer thermal energy
only very slowly.
Air is one of the worst conductors and so one of
the best insulators. This is why houses with cavity
walls (two layers of bricks separated by an air space)
and double-glazed windows keep warmer in winter
and cooler in summer.
Because air is such a bad conductor, materials
that trap air, such as wool, felt, fur, feathers,
polystyrene foam and fibreglass, are also very
bad conductors. Some of these materials are used
as ‘lagging’ to insulate water pipes, hot water
cylinders, ovens, refrigerators and the walls and
roofs of houses (Figures 2.3.12a and 2.3.12b).
Others are used to make warm winter clothes like
fleece jackets (Figure 2.3.12c on the next page).

Convection currents set up by electric, gas and
oil heaters help to warm our homes. Many so-
called ‘radiators’ are really convector heaters.
Warm air produced by the heater rises because it
is less dense than the colder air above. The cold
air sinks, is warmed by the heater and itself rises.
A convection current is set up which helps to warm
the whole room.
Convection currents also form in the water being
heated in hot water tanks, kettles and kitchen pans,
allowing water to be heated quickly.

An infrared thermometer detects the thermal
radiation emitted by an object and converts it into
an electrical signal. The temperature of the object can be determined from the radiant power detected
and the value is shown on a digital display. It is a
non-contact method and allows temperature to be
measured at a distance. Infrared thermometers are
frequently used to monitor the health of passengers
arriving at an airport.
