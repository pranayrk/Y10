<section>
Describe experiments to demonstrate the
properties of good thermal conductors and bad
thermal conductors (thermal insulators)
</section>
<section>

Describe thermal conduction in all solids in terms
of atomic or molecular lattice vibrations and also
in terms of the movement of free (delocalised)
electrons in metallic conductors
</section>
<section>
3	␇Describe, in terms of particles, why thermal
conduction is bad in gases and most liquids
</section>
<section>
4	␇Know that there are many solids that conduct
thermal energy better than thermal insulators
but do so less well than good thermal conductors
</section>
<section>
Know that convection is an important method of
thermal energy transfer in liquids and gases
</section>
<section>
2	␇Explain convection in liquids and gases in terms
of density changes and describe experiments to
illustrate convection
</section>
<section>
Know that thermal radiation is infrared radiation
and that all objects emit this radiation
</section>
<section>
2	␇Know that thermal energy transfer by thermal
radiation does not require a medium
</section>
<section>
Describe the effect of surface colour (black
or white) and texture (dull or shiny) on the
emission, absorption and reflection of infrared
radiation
</section>
<section>
Know that for an object to be at a constant
temperature it needs to transfer energy away
from the object at the same rate that it receives
energy
</section>
<section>
Know what happens to an object if the rate at
which it receives energy is less or more than the
rate at which it transfers energy away from the
object
</section>
<section>
6	␇Know how the temperature of the Earth is
affected by factors controlling the balance
between incoming radiation and radiation
emitted from the Earth’s surface
</section>
<section>
Describe experiments to distinguish between
good and bad emitters of infrared radiation
</section>
<section>
8	␇Describe experiments to distinguish between
good and bad absorbers of infrared radiation
</section>
<section>
9	␇Describe how the rate of emission of radiation
depends on the surface temperature and surface
area of an object
</section>
<section>
Explain some of the basic everyday applications
and consequences of conduction, convection and
radiation, including:
</section>
<section>
heating objects such as kitchen pans
heating a room by convection
</section>
<section>
Explain some of the complex applications and
consequences of conduction, convection and
radiation where more than one type of thermal
energy transfer is significant, including:


a fire burning wood or coal
a radiator in a car
