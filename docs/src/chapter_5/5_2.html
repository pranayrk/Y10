	### 5.2: Temperature

	> We have an intuitive concept of temperature as the ‘coldness’ or ‘hotness’ of a body, but it wasn’t until the 19th century that one of the greatest discoveries in physics related the concept of temperature to the random motion of molecules.


	* The nature of **heat** can be explained by considering particles of solids and liquids are in constant motion.
	* When heated they vibrate faster, so force each other a little further apart
	* Kinetic theory uses the idea that as particles heat up **they gain more kinetic energy and move faster**.

	### 5.2: Temperature

	> Temperature is proportional to the average random kinetic energy of the molecules.

	**Note:** This direct proportionality between temperature and the average random kinetic energy is only true for the Kelvin temperature scale.

	<h3>5.2: Temperature</h3>
	<p>The vibration in particles of a solid or liquid is because the particles have sort of <b>potential energy</b> </p>
	<p>This potential energy between particles help them stay together</p>

	<blockquote>$\text{Internal Energy} = \text{Total Kinetic Energy} + \text{Total Potential Energy}$</blockquote>
	<p>The more the internal energy, the faster the particles move</p>
	<p>Solids and liquids have some potential energy between particles, but gas particles are fully kinetic energy</p>

	### 5.2: Temperature
	* If the *average internal energy per molecule* in one part of an object is greater than another part, then the energy will spread out until it is evenly distributed.
	* This is known as **thermal interaction** and the movement of energy is known as **thermal energy** or **heat**
	* If the temperature of a substance increases, it is because the *average internal energy* of its molecules has increased.
	* Once all the particles of a substance have the same internal energy, we say it has reached **thermal equilibrium**.

	### 5.2: Temperature
	* Temperature can be measured with a thermometer, which is simply a device that has one property that changes in a predictable way as temperature changes. 
	* That property is volume in liquid-in-glass thermometers
		* the liquid column changes its volume
		* the length then changes since the cross-sectional area stays the same
	* Properties other than volume can be used, for example, electrical resistance.

	### 5.2: Temperature

	* All matter has internal energy. This is an **energy store** and we measure it to find the **temperature** of an object.
	* Energy is transferred from an object of higher temperature to an object of lower temperature. 
		* This is known as **thermal interaction**
	* **Thermal equilibrium** describes a state where two or more objects have the same temperature and there is no net transfer of energy between them.
	* **Heat** is energy that is transferred from one body to another as a result of a difference in temperature.
		* Heat is **thermal energy** and is measured in Joules

	### 5.2: Temperature
	* When a thermometer is used to measure the temperature of a body it has to come into contact with the body.
	* A **thermal interaction** takes place and energy is transferred until the thermometer and the body are at the same temperature.
	* The thermal energy causes the particles of the mercury to move away from each other and the mercury will expand
	* Once all the particles reach the same average internal energy, the mercury and the object are at **thermal equilibrium**.

	### 5.2: Temperature
	##### Celsius Scale
	* The Celsius scale was devised by the Swedish scientist **Anders Celsius**.
	* It has two fixed points:
		* $0^\circ C$: the melting point of pure ice at atmospheric pressure
		* $100^\circ C$: the boiling point of pure water at atmospheric pressure.

	##### Kelvin Scale

	* The Kelvin temperature scale starts from absolute zero, or −273 °C.

	> $$\text{temp in K} = \text{temp in $^\circ$C} + 273.15$$
