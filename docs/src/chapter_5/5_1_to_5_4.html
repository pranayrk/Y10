	<h3>Solid</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The distance between the particles is small, so solids have a <em>high density</em> and are <em>incompressible.</em></li>
		<li>As they are close together, the particles in solids have strong attractive forces between them.</li>
		<li>That is why solids have a <em>fixed volume</em>, <em>a fixed shape</em> and <em>cannot flow</em>.</li>

		<li>That is why liquids are <em>slightly less dense</em> but are still <em>incompressible</em> and have a <em>fixed volume</em>.</li>

		<li>Brownian motion refers to the random movement of microscopic particles in a fluid due to the collisions by the molecules of the fluid.</li>
		<li>Examples of microscopic particles are pollen grains and smoke particles.</li>

	<h5>Explanation of Brownian Motion</h5>
	<h6>Air consists mainly of nitrogen molecules $N_2$, and oxygen molecules $O_2$. These molecules are too small to be seen under the microscope. A smoke particle is a solid lump of many carbon atoms. When light is shone on a mixture of smoke particles in air, the smoke particles can be seen as tiny specks of reflected light. There are millions of molecules in the air moving at high speeds in all directions. This means that
there are many collisions on each smoke particle happening all the time. The smoke particle is
constantly pushed one way and then another. As we cannot see the molecules, the smoke particles
appear to be constantly moving small distances in a random path.</h6>

	<ul>
		<li>To observe Brownian motion in the lab, we use a <b>smoke cell</b> which is a transparent box with smoke trapped inside</li>
		<li>Shining a light through the cell and observing it under a microscope, we can see the smoke particles as <em>tiny bright specks of light following a zig-zag random motion</em>.</li>

	<ul>
		<li>The <b>kinetic energy</b> of particles in a substance depends on how fast the particles of the substances are moving or vibrating.</li>
		<li>The <b>potential energy</b> of particles in a substance arises mostly from intramolecular bonds.</li>
	</ul>
	<blockquote>
		$$\text{Internal Energy} = \text{Kinetic Energy} + \text{Potential Energy}$$
	</blockquote>
</section>
<section>
	<img src="images/temperature_internal_energy.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li>If you increase the internal energy by heating a substance, either:
			<ul>
				<li>the particles move faster (which <em>increases the total kinetic energy</em>)</li>
				<li>or the intramolecular bonds are weakened/broken (which <em>increases the total potential energy</em>).</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>You can measure the kinetic energy in particles with a thermometer. It is usually not possible to measure the internal energy of particles.</li>

		<li>The lowest temperature where the particles have the least kinetic energy occurs at $–273^\circ C$.</li>
		<li>This temperature is also known as <b>absolute zero</b>.</li>

	<h4>The Celsius Scale</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The Celsius scale is made by setting two important temperatures known as <b>fixed points</b> and then making equally spaced divisions between those points. The fixed points for the Celsius scale are:
			<ul>
				<li>The melting  point of pure ice at atmospheric pressure. This was set as $0^\circ C$</li>
				<li>The boiling point of pure water at atmospheric pressure. This was set as $100^\circ C$</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>The Kelvin Scale</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The Kelvin scale uses the fixed point absolute zero ($−273^\circ C$) which is the lowest temperate possible. This is set as $0\;K$</li>
		<li>The spacing of the divisions of the Celsius scale remains the same in the Kelvin scale.</li>
	</ul>

		<li>According to the kinetic theory of matter, the particles of solids and liquids are in constant vibration.</li>
		<li>When heated they vibrate faster and force each other a little further apart.</li>
		<li>This results in the object expanding when they are heated. This is known as <b>thermal expansion</b>.</li>

	<img height="400" src="images/axle_fitting.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li>The axles have are shrunk by cooling in liquid nitrogen at −196°C until the gear wheels can be slipped on to them.</li>
		<li>On regaining normal temperature, the axles expand to give a very tight fit.</li>

	<h5>Uses/Effects of Thermal Expansion</h5>
	<img height="300" src="images/gaps_in_railway.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li>Railway lines and bridges are subject to a lot of heating in the summer.</li>
		<li>If the expansion is resisted, large forces are created which could break the rail line.</li>
		<li>Gaps are normally left in railway lines and bridges to account for expansion in summer.</li>
	</ul>

<section>
	<h5>Uses/Effects of Thermal Expansion</h5>
	<img height="250" src="images/bimetallic_strip.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li>Some materials expand more than others. For example, copper expands more than iron when it is heated.</li>
	<li>If equal lengths copper and iron, are fixed together so that they cannot move separately, they form a <b>bimetallic strip</b>.</li>
	<li>When this strip is heated, the copper expands more than the iron. Since they are fixed together, this difference in expansion causes the strip bends with copper on the outside.</li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<h5>Uses of the Bimetallic Strip</h5>
	<img height="400" src="images/bimetallic_strip_fire_alarm.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li>Heat from the fire makes the bimetallic strip bend with the copper on the outside.</li>
		<li>This makes the strip come in contact and complete the electrical circuit, which rings the fire alarm bell.</li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section>
	<h5>Uses of the Bimetallic Strip</h5>
	<p>A <b>thermostat</b> keeps the temperature of a room or an appliance constant.</p>
	<img height="300" src="images/bimetallic_strip_iron_box.png"></img>
	<ul>
	<li>When the iron reaches the required temperature the strip bends down, breaks the circuit at the contacts and switches off the heater.</li>
	<li>After cooling a little, the strip remakes contact and turns the heater on again.</li>
	</li>
</section>
<section>
	<h5>Anomalous Expansion of Ice</h5>
	<img height="300" src="images/ice_water_graph.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li>Most materials expand when they are heated, and shrink when they are cooled.</li>
		<li>Surprisingly, when water is cooled below $4^\circ C$ it expands till it becomes ice.</li>
		<li>This results in every $100\; cm^3$ of water becoming $109\; cm^3$ of ice and causes ice to float on top of water.</li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<img height="300" src="images/gas_laws.jpeg"></img>
	<ul>
	<li>Just as solids and liquids expand when they are heated, gases try to expand when they are heated.</li>
	<li>The bounds of the container do not allow gases to expand, so this leads to a change in either pressure or temperature.</li>
	<li>The behaviour of a gas can be modelled considering the interdependance of <b>pressure, temperature, and volume</b>.</li>

		<li>This behaviour for <em>an individual atom</em> can be modelled by Newton's laws and the law of conservation of momentum.</li>

		<li>The force from one collision is very small but with so many particles colliding all the time, the force exerted can be large.</li>
		<li>Since its is inconvenient to model every atom in a gas, we normally consider the <em>average force per unit area</em> of all these collisions as the <b>pressure</b> of the gas on the container.</li>

	<li>This reduces the distance that each particle has to travel before hitting the wall of the container.</li>
	<li>This means that the <em>particles collide with the wall of the container more frequently.</em></li>
	<li>This increase in the number of collisions increases the pressure of the gas on the container.</li>

		<li>A <b>Bourdon gauge</b> will let us record this pressure.</li>
		<li>We can measure the change in volume by measuring the change in height of the air column (since the tube is a cylinder, the radius stays the same).</li>

		<li>We can notice that if we were to plot a graph of $P$ vs $V$, it would be a curved line (as on the left).</li>
		<li>To make the graph easier  to understand, we plot a graph of $P$ vs $\displaystyle \frac{1}{V}$, which will give us a straight line (as on the right).</li>

		<li>When a gas is heated, the <em>average kinetic energy</em> of its particles increase.</li>
		<li>This means on average, the particles move faster, and when they strike the wall of the container, they have a larger force.</li>
		<li>If the container is flexible, <em>this increased force will cause the container to expand outwards</em>, increasing its volume.</li>

	<li>If we conduct this experiment for multiple different pressures, and plot each set of data points on the same graph, we will get multiple lines.</li>
	<li>Extending these lines backward, we can see that all the lines will meet at the same point where the volume is 0.</li>
