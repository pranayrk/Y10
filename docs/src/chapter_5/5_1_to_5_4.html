	<h5>Explanation of Brownian Motion</h5>
	<h6>Air consists mainly of nitrogen molecules $N_2$, and oxygen molecules $O_2$. These molecules are too small to be seen under the microscope. A smoke particle is a solid lump of many carbon atoms. When light is shone on a mixture of smoke particles in air, the smoke particles can be seen as tiny specks of reflected light. There are millions of molecules in the air moving at high speeds in all directions. This means that
there are many collisions on each smoke particle happening all the time. The smoke particle is
constantly pushed one way and then another. As we cannot see the molecules, the smoke particles
appear to be constantly moving small distances in a random path.</h6>

Describe the pressure and the changes in pressure
of a gas in terms of the forces exerted by
particles colliding with surfaces, creating a force
per unit area


The gas particles are moving randomly in all directions. They collide with one another and with the
walls of the container. The pressure on the container is caused by the constant collisions of many
particles with its walls.
When the particles collide with the walls of the container, they exert a force on the wall (Figure 8.9).
The force from one collision is small but as there are many particles colliding all of the time, the force
exerted is large.

we learnt that pressure is force per unit area. Hence, the force exerted by the
collisions of gas particles on the container gives rise to the pressure on the container.

	> We have an intuitive concept of temperature as the ‘coldness’ or ‘hotness’ of a body, but it wasn’t until the 19th century that one of the greatest discoveries in physics related the concept of temperature to the random motion of molecules.


	* The nature of **heat** can be explained by considering particles of solids and liquids are in constant motion.
	* When heated they vibrate faster, so force each other a little further apart
	* Kinetic theory uses the idea that as particles heat up **they gain more kinetic energy and move faster**.

	<img src="images/thermometer.png"></img>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 5.2: Temperature
	* Temperature can be measured with a thermometer, which is simply a device that has one property that changes in a predictable way as temperature changes. 
	* That property is volume in liquid-in-glass thermometers
		* the liquid column changes its volume
		* the length then changes since the cross-sectional area stays the same
	* Properties other than volume can be used, for example, electrical resistance.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 5.2: Temperature

	* All matter has internal energy. This is an **energy store** and we measure it to find the **temperature** of an object.
	* Energy is transferred from an object of higher temperature to an object of lower temperature. 
		* This is known as **thermal interaction**
	* **Thermal equilibrium** describes a state where two or more objects have the same temperature and there is no net transfer of energy between them.
	* **Heat** is energy that is transferred from one body to another as a result of a difference in temperature.
		* Heat is **thermal energy** and is measured in Joules
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 5.2: Temperature
	* When a thermometer is used to measure the temperature of a body it has to come into contact with the body.
	* A **thermal interaction** takes place and energy is transferred until the thermometer and the body are at the same temperature.
	* The thermal energy causes the particles of the mercury to move away from each other and the mercury will expand
	* Once all the particles reach the same average internal energy, the mercury and the object are at **thermal equilibrium**.

	* The Celsius scale was devised by the Swedish scientist **Anders Celsius**.

	What happens to a gas when it is heated? Consider the same gas at a
higher temperature. The higher the temperature of a gas, the faster its particles
are moving. The particles will hit the walls more often and with more force. This
increases the pressure.

	Kinetic model of matter on gas pressure

	All the particles in a gas are in rapid random
motion, with a wide range of speeds, and repeatedly
hit and rebound from the surfaces of the container
in huge numbers per second.
This causes a pressure on the surfaces of the
container. When the temperature of the gas rises,
so does the average speed and kinetic energy of
the particles. Collisions with the surfaces of the
container occur more frequently and so the pressure
of the gas increases.
</section>
<section>
	Force and gas pressure
At each collision of a gas particle with a surface
of the container, it undergoes a change of
momentum which produces a force on the surface
(see Topic 1.6). At a constant temperature the
average force and hence the pressure exerted on
the surface is constant, since pressure is force
per unit area. When the temperature rises and the
rate at which collisions with the surfaces of the
container increases, so does the average force and
hence the gas pressure.
