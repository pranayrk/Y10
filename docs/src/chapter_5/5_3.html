	Thermal expansion
According to the kinetic particle model (Topic 2.1.2)

The linear (length) expansion of solids is small
and for the effect to be noticed, the solid must
be long and/or the temperature change must be
large. For a 1 m length of steel it is 0.012 mm for
a 1°C rise in temperature.
The particles in a liquid are further apart, less
ordered and are more mobile than in a solid so
the interaction between the particles is less and
expansion is easier for liquids than for solids.
Liquids typically expand about five times more
than solids for a given temperature rise. In gases,
the interactions between particles are few
because they are far apart and move about very
quickly; this means they are able to expand much
more easily than liquids. Typically, gases expand
about 20 times more than liquids for a given
temperature rise. These figures indicate that
gases expand much more readily than liquids, and
liquids expand more readily than solids.






The temperature of a body tells us how hot the body
is. It is measured using a thermometer usually in
degrees Celsius (0°C).
In the liquid-in-glass thermometer the liquid in
a glass bulb expands up a capillary tube when the
bulb is heated. The liquid must be easily seen and
must expand (or contract) rapidly and by a large
amount over a wide range of temperature. It must
not stick to the inside of the tube or the reading
will be too high when the temperature is falling.
Mercury and coloured alcohol are commonly used
liquids in this type of thermometer. Mercury freezes
at −39°C and boils at 357°C but is a toxic material.
A non-toxic metal alloy substitute for mercury,
such as Galinstan, is often used nowadays; it melts
at −19°C and boils at 1300°C. Alcohol freezes at
−115°C and boils at 78°C and is therefore more
suitable for low temperatures.

	<p>According to the kinetic theory, the particles of solids and liquids are in constant vibration.</p>
	<p>When heated they vibrate faster, so force each other a little further apart and expansion results.</p>

	<p>The axles have are shrunk by cooling in liquid nitrogen at −196°C until the gear wheels can be slipped on to them.<p>
	<p>On regaining normal temperature, the axles expand to give a very tight fit.</p>

	<p>If equal lengths of two different metals, such as copper and iron, are riveted together so that they cannot move separately, they form a <b>bimetallic strip</b></p>
	<p>When heated, copper expands more than iron and to allow this the strip bends with copper on the outside</p>

	<p>Heat from the fire makes the bimetallic strip bend and complete the electrical circuit, so ringing the fire alarm bell</p>

	<p>A <b>thermostat</b> keeps the temperature of a room or an appliance constant.</p>
	<img height="300" src="images/bimetallic_strip_iron_box.png"></img>
	<p>When the iron reaches the required temperature the strip bends down, breaks the circuit at the contacts and switches off the heater.<p>
	<p>After cooling a little, the strip remakes contact and turns the heater on again.</p>

	<p>If the expansion is resisted large forces are created which could break things</p>
	<p>Gaps are normally left in railway lines and bridges to account for expansion in summer</p>

	<p>Between 4°C and 0°C water surprisingly expands.</p>
	<p>At 0°C, when it freezes, volume expansion occurs and every $100\; cm^3$ of water becomes $109\; cm^3$ of ice.</p>
