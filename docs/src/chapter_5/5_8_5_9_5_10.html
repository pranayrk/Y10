	**Specific heat capacity** $c$ is defined as the amount of thermal energy required to raise the temperature of a $1\\;kg$ of a substance by $1^\circ C$ (or $1 \\;K$).
	> This gives us the equation for specific heat capacity:
	>	$$c = \frac{\Delta E}{m \Delta \theta}$$

	> The equation can be rearranged as $\Delta E = mc\Delta \theta$.

	The SI unit of specific heat capacity is $J/(kg K)$ or $J/(kg^\circ C)$.

	<h5>Experiment to determine specific heat capacity of a metal</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Before switching on the heater, we record the mass $m$ of the block using a weighing scale and record the temperature of the block.</li>
		<li>The heater is of known power $P$. Switching on the heater for a time period $t$, we can calculate the energy supplied to the block as $E = P \times t$.</li>
		<li>After time $t$, we measure the temperature and find the temperature difference $\Delta \theta$.</li>

		<li>During a <b>phase change</b>, the temperature will seem to be constant.</li>
		<li><b>Melting and Boiling:</b> The particles of solids and liquids have bonds between them.  During melting or boiling, all the heat energy is used to break the bonds and separate the particles. The melting point of water is $0^\circ C$ and the boiling point is $100^\circ C$.</li>
		<li><b>Condensation and Solidification: </b> During condensation and solidification, the particles move closer together and form bonds. When bonds are formed, energy is released.</li>

	<ul>
		<li>The fastest moving particles escape into the air, leaving behind the particles with lower energy.</li>
		<li>The average kinetic energy of the particles decreases, leading to a drop in temperature. This is known as the <b>cooling effect of evaporation</b>.</li>
	</ul>

<section>
	<h5>Factors affecting evaporation</h5>
	<p>The rate of evaporation is increased with:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Higher Temperature:</b> more particles in the liquid are moving at high speeds, which increases the rate of evaporation.</li>
		<li><b>Large Surface Area</b> gives more chances for the particles to escape, increasing the speed of evaporation.</li>
		<li><b>Air Flow:</b> over the surface of the liquid carries away vapour particles from the surface, stopping them from falling back to the surface.</b>
	</ul>

	* The **specific latent heat of fusion (lf)** of a substance is the quantity of heat needed to change $1\\;kg$ of a solid to liquid.
	* In general, the quantity of heat $\Delta E$ needed to change a mass $m$ from solid to liquid is given by
	$$ \Delta E = m × lf$$
	* The SI unit of specific latent heat is measured in $J/kg$.

	* The **latent heat of fusion** for water is $33.5 \times 10^4 J/kg$.
	* The **latent heat of vaporization** for water is $22.6 \times 10^5 J/kg$


	* To change $1 \\;kg$ of water at $100^\circ C$ to steam at $100^\circ C$ needs over five times as much heat as is needed to raise the temperature of $1 \\;kg$ of water at $0^\circ C$ to water at $100^\circ C$.
