	* When you boil water for a drink, the more water you heat, the longer it takes to boil. This shows that **the thermal energy needed depends on the mass of water being heated**. 
	* If the water is colder to begin with, it takes longer to boil. This shows that **the thermal energy needed depends on the temperature change**.
	* Water takes a lot of thermal energy to heat up compared with other substances. This is why sand on a beach heats up — and cools down — more quickly than the sea. This shows that **the thermal energy needed depends on the material being heated**.

	**Specific heat capacity** $c$ is defined as the amount of thermal energy required to raise the temperature of a $1\\;kg$ of a substance by $1^\circ C$ (or $1 \\;K$).
	> The definition gives us the equation for specific heat capacity:
	>	$$c = \frac{\Delta E}{m \Delta \theta}$$
	> where $\Delta E =$ thermal energy required (in $J$)  
	> and $\Delta θ =$ temperature change (in K or °C)   
	> $m = $mass of substance (in kg)
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	> The equation can be rearranged as $\Delta E = mc\Delta \theta$.

	* The SI unit of specific heat capacity is
		* joule per kilogram per kelvin, $J/(kg K)$
		* joule per kilogram per degree Celcius, $J/(kg^\circ C)$.

	* The **specific latent heat of fusion (lf)** of a substance is the quantity of heat needed to change $1\\;kg$ of a solid to liquid.
	* In general, the quantity of heat $\Delta E$ needed to change a mass $m$ from solid to liquid is given by
	$$ \Delta E = m × lf$$

* The **latent heat of fusion** for water is $33.5 \times 10^4 J/kg$.
* The **latent heat of vaporization** for water is $22.6 \times 10^5 J/kg$


* To change $1 \\;kg$ of water at $100^\circ C$ to steam at $100^\circ C$ needs over five times as much heat as is needed to raise the temperature of $1 \\;kg$ of water at $0^\circ C$ to water at $100^\circ C$.
