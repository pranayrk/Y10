Allstown is a town on the coast that needs a new power station. Allstown has a busy port and good
road and rail links, which are shown on the map below. The land around Allstown is flat. The power
station built must supply at least 30 MW of power, enough for 20 000 homes, at all times.
These projects have been suggested:
N
• An offshore wind farm with 12 turbines. Each turbine
generates 3 MW in suitable weather conditions. In
future, more turbines may be added.
• A biomass plant using wood pulp and waste from
local businesses. It generates 35 MW at all times.
• A combined heat and power station that uses natural
gas. This generates 32 MW of electricity and provides
heating directly to 5000 homes from waste heat
produced by the power station.

Use your ideas about the electricity production to recommend the most suitable power station for
Allstown. You should also explain why you do not recommend the other projects.



A new power station is needed to supply 10 000 homes with electricity. The houses are in a city with
good road and rail transport links to the site. The developer must choose between a biomass power
station or a combined heat and power station.

Explain one advantage and one disadvantage of each power station.

Suggest, with a reason, which power station is more suitable for the site.



Meteors are formed from small particles of dust that orbit the Sun. Sometimes meteors enter the
Earth’s atmosphere and cause a bright streak of light.
a) A meteor with a mass of 0.0 003 kg enters the Earth’s atmosphere travelling at a
velocity of 18 000 m/s.
Calculate the meteor’s kinetic energy. State the unit of energy.

Explain what happens to the meteor’s kinetic energy as it passes through the atmosphere, and
use these ideas to suggest why very few meteors hit the ground.



The Sankey diagrams compare energy transfers in a filament lamp and an energy-saving lamp.
What is the output energy of the filament bulb? Circle the correct answer.
A 60 J
B 3J
C 57 J

Calculate the efficiency of the filament lamp.


A student decides to replace a 60 W filament bulb. Energy-saving bulbs of power 7 W, 12 W, 18 W
or 23 W are available.
