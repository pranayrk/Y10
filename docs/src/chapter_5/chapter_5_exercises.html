	> Two girls want to weigh a watermelon, but they do not have a kitchen scale. So they use a spring and a $1 \\;kg$ bag of sugar to measure. When suspended, the bag of sugar stretches the spring by $50\\; mm$, while the watermelon stretches the spring by $75\\; mm$. Assuming that the
	extension of the watermelon is within the limit of proportionality,
	> * calculate the spring constant of the spring;
	> * calculate the weight of the watermelon.
