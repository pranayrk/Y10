If 1 kg of water and 1 kg of paraffin are heated in
turn for the same time by the same heater, the
temperature rise of the paraffin is about twice
that of the water. Since the heater gives equal
amounts of thermal energy to each liquid, it
seems that different substances require different
amounts of energy to cause the same temperature
rise in the same mass, say 1°C in 1 kg.
The amount of heat required to raise the
temperature of a particular substance by one
degree is measured by its specific heat capacity
(symbol c).
The specific heat capacity of a substance is
defined as the energy required per unit mass per
unit temperature increase.
In physics, the word ‘specific’ means that unit
mass is being considered.
In general, for a mass m, receiving energy ΔE
which results in a temperature rise Δθ, this can
be written in equation form as
ΔE
mΔθ
where c is the specific heat capacity of a material
of mass m whose temperature rises by Δθ when
its internal energy increases by ΔE.
Internal energy is measured in joules (J) and
the unit of specific heat capacity is the joule per
kilogram per °C, i.e. J/(kg °C).

ΔE = mcΔθ = mass × specific heat capacity ×
temperature rise



The specific heat capacity of water is 4200 J/(kg °C)
and that of soil is about 800 J/(kg °C). As a result,
the temperature of the sea rises and falls more
slowly than that of the land. A certain mass of water
needs five times more energy than the same mass of
soil for its temperature to rise by 1°C. Water also has
to give out more energy to fall 1°C. Since islands are
surrounded by water, they experience much smaller
changes of temperature from summer to winter than
large land masses such as Central Asia.
The high specific heat capacity of water (as
well as its cheapness and availability) accounts for
its use in cooling engines and in the radiators of
central heating systems.
