	### Spring Experiment

	A student is investigating how the material of a spring affects its behaviour when stretched.
	The following apparatus is available to the student:
	* wires of different thickness, length and material
	* a set of 10 g masses and a set of 100 g masses, both with hangers
	* a wooden rod approximately 1 cm in diameter
	* other standard laboratory equipment.

	Plan an experiment which will enable you to test the extension of springs made from different
types of wire.

	<h3>Spring Experiment</h3>

	<h5>In your plan, you should include</h5>
	<p><b>1. instructions for making a spring from the wire that is provided</b></p>
	<p class="fragment">springs made by winding wire around rod (or similar)</p>
	<p><b>2. what you will measure</b></p>
	<p class="fragment">take different readings under different loads for each spring material</p>

	<h3>Spring Experiment</h3>
	<p><b>3. instructions for carrying out the experiment</b></p>
	<ul>

		<li class="fragment">apply load, measure length / extension of spring</li>
		<li class="fragment">repeat for spring(s) of different material</li>
		<li class="fragment">record results in suitable annotated table / bar chart / graph</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><b>4. the variables you will keep the same to ensure the comparison is a fair test</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li class="fragment">unstretched length of spring</li>
		<li class="fragment">diameter of wire</li>
		<li class="fragment">coil spacing</li>
		<li class="fragment">load / range of loads used</li>
		<li class="fragment">diameter of spring</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Spring Experiment</h3>
	<p><b>5. any precaution which should be taken or difficulty which might occur</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li class="fragment">clamp the retort stand or it might topple</li>
		<li class="fragment">use small loads or spring might overstretch</li>
		<li class="fragment">loads need to apply force smoothly / slowly</li>
		<li class="fragment">have a workable arrangement for applying load to spring (e.g. small loop at end of spring)</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>6. Describe how you will conduct the experiment and ensure accuracy of results</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li class="fragment">trial experiment to find (range of) loads to use</li>
		<li class="fragment">how to determine extension of spring</li>
		<li class="fragment">repeat each reading and take average</li>
		<li class="fragment">at least 5 different loads for each sample if producing graph</li>
	</ul>
