	### What will be on Paper 6?

	You may be asked questions on the following experimental contexts:

	* measurement of physical quantities such as length or volume or force
	* springs and balances
	* timing motion or oscillations
	* optics equipment such as mirrors, prisms and lenses
	* cooling and heating
	* electric circuits
	* procedures using simple apparatus, in situations where the method may not be familiar to you.

	### Tips for Paper 6
	* When plotting a graph
		* choose the scales so that the plots occupy more than half of the graph grid. 
		* You should always use a sharp pencil 
		* plot small, neat, accurately placed crosses. 
		* Then draw a neat thin best-fit line.
	* You should understand that if $y$ is proportional to $x$ then the graph will be a straight line through the origin.

	### Tips for Paper 6

	* Diagrams should be drawn with care using a sharp pencil.
	* Column headings in tables of readings must be headed with the quantity and unit
	* Graph axes are labelled in the same way.
	* Final answers should be given to *two or three significant figures*.

	### Tips for Paper 6

	* When carrying out practical work there are usually measurements that are in some way difficult to take in spite of taking great care. 
		* You should comment about these difficulties when asked about precautions taken to improve accuracy.
	* If you are asked to justify a statement that you have made it must be justified by reference to the readings. A theoretical justification in a practical test will not gain marks.
	* **Identify the sensitivity of the apparatus** and record the readings per the sensitivity of the apparatus

	### Tips for Paper 6

	* Include a good diagram, key factor of investigation, proper steps, independent dependant and control variables along with a solid conclusion
	* Its always good to add a formula in the conclusion. 
	* Go though past papers and see the expected answers. Usually they tend to overlap a lot

	### Examples of Precautions to Take

	* Measuring cylinder
    		* line of sight below meniscus
    		* look perpendicularly

	* Pivot
    		* loads might obscure the scale
    		* Difficult to find best balance position
    		* Difficult to find center of load.
    		* Load might slip off the ruler


		<!--


Temp precaution:

    stir before reading

    Read thermometer perpendicularly

    Give enough time for reading to stop rising

    Donâ€™t let thermometer touch beaker (to measure temp of liquid NOT beaker)


Ray tracing:

    Make sure pins not bent/straight/vertical

    Look at base of pin

    Place pins ~5 cm apart

    Outline of block might be bigger than actual block

    Difficult to draw thin accurate lines

    Difficult to see pins clearly

Light:

    move lens slowly back and forth to get focus image

    Dark room
    
    Make sure screen, object and lamp are all vertical

    Clamp rule to bench

    10-45 cm distance of u
