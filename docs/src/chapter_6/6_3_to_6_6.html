Describe the production of sound by vibrating
sources

Describe the longitudinal nature of sound waves


State the approximate range of frequencies
audible to humans as 20 Hz to 20 000 Hz


Know that a medium is needed to transmit sound
waves


Know that the speed of sound in air is
approximately 330–350 m / s


Describe compression and rarefaction


␇Know that, in general, sound travels faster in
solids than in liquids and faster in liquids than in
gases

Describe a method involving a measurement of
distance and time for determining the speed of
sound in air


Describe how changes in amplitude and
frequency affect the loudness and pitch of sound
waves


Describe an echo as the reflection of sound
waves


Define ultrasound as sound with a frequency
higher than 20 kHz


Describe the uses of ultrasound in non-
destructive testing of materials, medical scanning
of soft tissue and sonar including calculation of
depth or distance from time and wave speed
