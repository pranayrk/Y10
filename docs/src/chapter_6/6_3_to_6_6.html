		<li><b>Sound</b> is produced by vibrating sources placed in a <em>medium</em>. The medium is usually air, but it can be any gas, liquid or solid.</li>
		<li>In a sound wave, the air molecules move repeatedly closer together and then further apart in the direction of travel of the wave.</li>
	</ul>

	<h6>The speaker has a cone which is made to vibrate in and out by an electric current. When the cone moves out, the air in front is compressed; when it moves in, the air is rarefied (becomes ‘thinner’). The wave progresses through the air but the air as a whole does not move. The air particles (molecules) vibrate backwards and forwards a little as the wave passes. When the wave enters your ear the compressions and rarefactions cause small, rapid pressure changes on the eardrum and you experience the sensation of sound.</h6>

		<li><em>Sound is a longitudinal wave</em>, the direction of vibration of air molecules is parallel to the direction in which the wave travels.</li>

		<li>Like all longitudinal waves, sound waves propagate as a series of compressions (C) and rarefactions (R).
			<ul>
				<li><b>Compressions</b> are regions where air pressure is higher than the surrounding air pressure.</li>
				<li><b>Rarefactions</b> are regions where air pressure is lower than the surrounding air pressure.</li>

	<ul>
		<li><em>Any medium which contains particles that can vibrate will transmit sound.</em> However, the speed of sound in different materials might differ.</li>
		<li>$\text{speed in gas}<  \text{speed in liquid} < \text{speed in solid}$</li>
		<li>This is because the molecules in a solid are closer together than in a liquid and those in a liquid are closer together than in a gas.</li>
		<li>The speed of sound in air is approximately $330–350 \;m/s$.
	<ul>
		<li>In air the speed increases with temperature and at high altitudes</li>

	<h5>Direct Method</h5>

	<p>The speed of sound in air can be found directly by measuring the time $t$ taken for a sound to travel past two microphones separated by a distance $d$.</p>


	<h6>This method can also be used to find the speed of sound in different materials. For example, placing a metal bar between the microphones would allow the speed of sound in the metal to be determined.</li>

		<li>If the distance between the microphones is $1.2 \;m$ and the timer records an average time interval of $3.6 \;ms$ between the start and stop signals, calculate a value for the speed of sound in air.</li>

	<h5>Echo Method</h5>
	<ul>

		<li>An estimate of the speed of sound in air can be made directly if you stand about 100 metres from a high wall or building and clap your hands. Echoes are produces</li>
		<li>When the clapping rate is such that each clap coincides with the echo of the previous one, the sound has travelled to the wall and back in the time between two claps, call this one interval.</li>
		<li>By timing 30 intervals with a stopwatch, the time $t$ for one interval can be found.</li>
		<li>Also, knowing the distance d to the wall, a rough value of the speed of sound is obtained.</li>

		<li>A ship uses a sonar as a depth sounder to measure the depth of a seabed. It sends a pulse of sound downwards into the sea. An echo from the seabed is received $0.3 \;s$ after the pulse is sent. If the speed of sound in water is $1500\; m/s$, determine the depth of the sea.</li>


		<li>A pulse of sound is transmitted from a ship towards the seabed. If the echo is received after $1.0\; s$, calculate the depth of the sea, given that the speed of sound in water is $1500 \;m/s$.</li>
