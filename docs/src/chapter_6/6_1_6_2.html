		<li>Wave motion is made up of periodic motion or motion repeated at regular intervals.</li>
		<li>A <b>wave</b> is a periodic disturbance that transfers energy from one place to another.</li>
		<li>It does not transfer matter during the energy transfer.</li>
		<li>A <b>mechanical wave</b> is a wave that is an oscillation of matter, and therefore transfers energy through a material medium.</li>

<p>A <b>transverse wave</b> is a wave that oscillates perpendicularly to the direction of the wave's travel.</p>
</section>
<section>
<img height="500" src="images/longitudnal_waves.png"></img>
<p><b>Longitudinal waves</b> are waves which oscillate in the direction which is parallel to the direction in which the wave travels.</p>

	<ul>

		<li>The <b>amplitude</b> $A$ of a wave is the maximum displacement of a point from its rest position. Its SI unit is the metre (m).</li>
		<li>The <b>wavelength</b> $\lambda$ of a wave is the distance between any two consecutive points in phase. Its SI unit is the metre (m).</li>
		<li>The <b>period</b> $T$ of a wave is the time taken to produce one complete wave. Its SI unit is the second (s).</li>
		<li>The <b>frequency</b> $f$ of a wave is the number of complete waves produced per second. Its SI unit is the hertz (Hz).</li>

	<p>We can relate frequency to period by the equation $f = \displaystyle \frac{1}{T}$</p>

<section>
5	␇Know that for a transverse wave, the
direction of vibration is at right angles to the
direction of propagation and understand that
electromagnetic radiation, water waves and
seismic S-waves (secondary) can be modelled as
transverse
</section>
<section>
Know that for a longitudinal wave, the direction
of vibration is parallel to the direction of
propagation and understand that sound waves
and seismic P-waves (primary) can be modelled
as longitudinal

</section>
<section>
	Demonstrate the difference between seismic P-waves and S-waves by using multiple springs (or slinkies).

	Learners can research how earthquakes and seismic waves are produced. They may enjoy looking at the Earthquake
Track website: (I)
https://earthquaketrack.com
</section>
<section>
	Learners investigate what happens when two waves meet in a spring (or slinky). Two waves travelling towards each
other do not reflect off each other, like two balls would bounce off each other. Introduce the idea of superposition of
waves and how they can lead to constructive and destructive interference.
</section>

<section>
Describe how waves can undergo:
(a) reflection at a plane surface
(b) refraction due to a change of speed
(c) diffraction through a narrow gap

</section>

Describe the use of a ripple tank to show:
(a) reflection at a plane surface
(b)	␇refraction due to a change in speed caused by
a change in depth
(c) diffraction due to a gap
(d) diffraction due to an edge


Introduce the phenomena of reflection, refraction and diffraction using a ripple tank. Reflection can be shown at different
angles using a barrier. Refraction can be tricky to demonstrate clearly; it requires a shallower/deeper region of water.
You could use a simulation to help clarify.

A wavefront is an imaginary line on a wave that joins all adjacent points that are in phase.
<section>
<section>
	Show learners different diagrams depicting reflection, refraction or diffraction and ask learners to identify which case is
shown. They could use miniature whiteboards for their answers.

9	␇Describe how wavelength and gap size affects
10	␇Describe how wavelength affects diffraction at an edge
diffraction through a gap
Learners identify that diffraction through different-sized gaps will show different amounts of spreading and can cause the
wavefront to become more or less curved. The size of wavelength also affects the diffraction through a gap, as well as at
an edge.

to why it produces patches of darkness?
