	### 4.4: Efficiency and Power

	* The **power** of a thing is the work it does per second, i.e. the rate at which it does work.
	* This is the same as the rate at which it transfers energy from one store to another.
	* The SI unit of power is the **Watt** ($W$) and is a rate of working of $1J$ per second

	> $$\text{power} = \frac{\text{work done}}{\text{time taken}} = \frac{\text{energy transferred}}{\text{time taken}}$$

	<blockquote>$ \text{power} = \text{force} \times \text{speed}$</blockquote>

	### 4.4: Efficiency and Power
	**Q1.** A boy whose weight is $600\\; N$ runs up a flight of stairs $10\\; m$ high in $12\\; s$. What is his average power?

	**Q2.** Calculate the power of a lamp that transfers $2400\\; J$ of electrical energy to thermal energy in $1$ minute.

	**Q3.** An escalator carries 60 people of average mass $70\\; kg$ to a height of $5 \\;m$ in one minute. Find the power needed to do this.

	$$\begin{aligned} \text{total energy input} & = \text{useful energy output} \\\\ & \quad + \text{wasted energy output} \end{aligned}$$
	* The **efficiency** of a device is the percentage of the energy supplied to it that is useful
	> $$\text{efficiency} = \frac{\text{useful work done}}{\text{total energy input}} \times 100\\%$$

	### 4.4: Efficiency and Power
	* A device is **efficient** if it transfers energy mainly to useful stores and the lost energy is small.

	* Another way that efficiency can be calculated is to use *power*:

	> $$\text{efficiency} = \frac{\text{useful power output}}{\text{total power input}} \times 100 \\%$$

	### 4.4: Efficiency and Power
	* The energy input to an electric motor is $400\\; J$ when raising a load of $200\\; N$ through a vertical distance of $1.5\\; m$. Calculate the efficiency of the motor.

	* If the energy input to an electric drill is $300\\; J/s$ and it transfers $100\\; J/s$ of energy to thermal energy when in
	use, calculate its efficiency.

	* Calculate the efficiency of a compact fluorescent light if a power input of $20 \\;J/s$ gives an output power of $9\\; J/s$.
