	### 4.4: Efficiency and Power

	* The **power** of a thing is the work it does per second, i.e. the rate at which it does work.
	* This is the same as the rate at which it transfers energy from one store to another.
	* The SI unit of power is the **Watt** ($W$) and is a rate of working of $1J$ per second

	> $$\text{power} = \frac{\text{work done}}{\text{time taken}} = \frac{\text{energy transferred}}{\text{time taken}}$$

	**Q1.** A boy whose weight is $600\\; N$ runs up a flight of stairs $10\\; m$ high in $12\\; s$. What is his average power?

	**Q2.** Calculate the power of a lamp that transfers $2400\\; J$ to thermal energy in $1$ minute.

	**Q3.** An escalator carries 60 people of average mass $70\\; kg$ to a height of $5 \\;m$ in one minute. Find the power needed to do this.

	### 4.4: Efficiency and Power
	* The efficiency of a device is the percentage
of the energy supplied to it that is usefully
transferred.
* Based on the principle of conservation of energy,
total energy input = useful energy output + wasted energy output.
	$$\text{efficiency} = useful work done/total energy input * 100%$$

	or

	$$efficiency = useful work done/total energy input * 100%$$


	* A device is efficient if it transfers energy mainly
to useful stores and the lost energy is small.
	or

	$$efficiency = useful power output/total power input$

	The energy input to an electric motor is 400 J when
raising a load of 200 N through a vertical distance of
1.5 m. Calculate the efficiency of the motor.

If the energy input to an electric drill is 300 J/s and it
transfers 100 J/s of energy to thermal energy when in
use, calculate its efficiency.

Calculate the efficiency of a compact
fluorescent light if a power input of 20 J/s gives
an output power of 9 J/s.
