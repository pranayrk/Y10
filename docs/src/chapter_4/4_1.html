	### 4.1: Work and Energy

	* Energy exists in different forms. 
	* Stored energy is very useful and is called **potential energy**.
	* **Examples of energy stores:** Gravitational, elastic strain, chemical, electric, magnetic and nuclear
	* **Examples of energy transfer:** kinetic energy, electrical energy, thermal energy, radiant energy, wave energy

	### 4.1: Work and Energy
	##### Stores of Energy

	* A moving object has **kinetic energy**: The faster an object moves, the greater its kinetic energy.
	* If you lift an object upwards, you give it **gravitational potential energy**.
	* Fuels such as coal or petrol are stores of **chemical energy**. 
	* Batteries are also stores of chemical energy.
	* Uranium is an example of a nuclear fuel, which is a store of **nuclear energy**. 
	* If you stretch a rubber band, it becomes a store of **strain energy**, also known as **elastic energy**.
	* If you heat an object so that it gets hotter, you are giving energy to its atoms. The energy stored in a hot object is called **internal energy**.
	* If you get close to a hot object, you may feel **thermal energy** coming from it.

	### 4.1: Work and Energy
	> When anything changes, energy is transferred.

	* This energy which is transferred to an object to cause some change is called **work**.
	* The SI unit of work is the **Joule** (J)

	> $$\text{work done} = \text{energy transferred}$$
	> or 
	> $$W = \Delta E$$

	### 4.1: Work and Energy

	* **Mechanical work** is done when a force moves something.
	* No work is done *in the scientific sense* by someone standing still holding a heavy pile of books: an upward force is exerted, but no motion results.
	* The amount of work done $W$ depends on the size of the force $F$ applied and the distance $d$ it moves.

	<p>In physics, no work is done if the object does not move</p>

	### 4.1: Work and Energy
	For **mechanical work** in particular, we can use the following equation:

	> $$ \begin{aligned} \text{work done} & = \text{force} \times \text{distance moved in the}  \\\\ & \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \text{ direction of force} \end{aligned} $$
	> or 
	> $$ W = F \times d$$

	**Question:** A librarian pushes a trolley of books for shelving. The horizontal force $F$ exerted by the librarian on the trolley is $8\\; N$ and the trolley moves a distance of $5\\; m$ in the direction of the force.
	* Calculate the work done on the trolley
	* Explain what happened to the mechanical work done

	**Question:** A car moving in a straight line with $2.0 × 10^5 \\;J$ of kinetic energy is brought to a
	stop by a constant resistive force of $4.0 × 10^3\\; N$. What is the stopping distance?
