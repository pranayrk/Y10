	### 4.3: Calculating PE and KE

	* Potential energy is the energy an object has because of its position or condition.
	* **Gravitational potential energy** $E_P$ is energy possessed by a mass because of its position in a gravitational field.
	* When a mass is moved away from the Earth: 
		* the work done on the mass against the field
		* increase in gravitational potential energy $\Delta E_P$
	* When a mass moves towards the Earth:
		* the work is done by the field on the mass
		* results in a decrease in gravitational potential energy

	### 4.3: Calculating PE and KE

	* We use $\Delta E_p$ because most points on the surface of the Earth are not considered to have zero gravitational potential energy.
	* To lift an object of mass $m$ through a vertical height $\Delta h$ in a gravitational field with strength $g$ needs a force equal and opposite to the weight $mg$ of the body.

	<h3>4.3: Calculating PE and KE</h3>
	<p>If you lift a mass of $3\; kg$ vertically through $2\; m$, you have to exert a vertically upward force equal to the weight of the body</p>
	<p>So work done is $30\; N \times 2\; m = 60\; N m = 60 \;J$.</p>

	### 4.3: Calculating PE and KE

	Using the equation $W = F \times d$, we can find:

	> $$\text{change in g.p.e} = \text{mass} \times g \times \text{change in height}$$
	> or 
	> $$\Delta E_p = mg \Delta h$$

	If $m$ is in $kg$ and $g$ in $m/s^2$ and $Î”h$ in $m$,

	then $\Delta E_p$ is in $J$.

	### 4.3: Calculating PE and KE

	* You can raise an object in two ways:
	* straight up at an angle of $90^\circ$ from horizontal
	* at an angle less than $90^\circ$ to the horizontal surface
	* less force will be needed, but the distance moved will be greater. 
	* If there is no friction, the *work done will be the same*.

	### 4.3: Calculating PE and KE

	* **Kinetic energy** is the energy an object has because of its motion. 
	* Work has to be done to make objects move, or move faster. 

	* For an object of mass m travelling with velocity v

	> $$\text{kinetic energy} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{mass} \times \text{velocity}^2$$
	> or
	> $$E_k = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$$

	* If mass is in $kg$ and velocity is in $m/s$, then kinetic energy is in $J$.

	**Question:** Calculate the kinetic energy of a car of mass $x$ travelling at 
	* $10\\;km/h$
	* $100\\;km/h$

	**Question:** The car's engine is turned off and it is allowed to roll to a stop. Calculate the distance the car travels in both the above cases if friction provides a force of $1\\;N$

	**Note:** This shows that increasing the speed $10$ times makes it take $100$ times as much distance to stop.

	* A mass above the ground has gravitational potential energy $mg\Delta h$ 
	* When it falls, its speed increases and:
	* it gains kinetic energy
	* loses gravitational potential energy
	* If it starts from rest and air resistance is negligible: 
	* the kinetic energy gained on reaching the ground equals the gravitational potential energy lost
	* $E_k = \Delta E_p$

	### 4.3: Calculating PE and KE
	* In the case of a pendulum, kinetic and gravitational potential energy are interchanged continually. 
	* The energy of the bob is
	* fully gravitational potential energy at the end of the swing
	* all kinetic energy as it passes through its central position
	* In other positions it has both gravitational potential and kinetic energy.
	* Eventually all the energy is transferred to thermal energy as a result of overcoming air resistance.

	The trolley of books pushed by the librarian in Worked Example 6D has a mass of 80 kg. After
	pushing the trolley over a horizontal distance, he reaches the bottom of a gentle incline with a
	certain speed v. The vertical height of the incline is 0.5 m. In order to maintain the same speed v
	up the incline, the librarian exerts a much larger force of 40 N to push the trolley over a distance
	of 10 m along the incline.
	Assuming negligible air resistance and frictional effects at the moving parts of the trolley,
	(a) calculate the work done by the 40 N force on the trolley along the incline;
	(b) calculate the gain in gravitational potential energy of the trolley.
	(Take g = 10 N/kg)
