		<li><b>Energy</b> is defined as the <em>ability to do work</em>, which means having the capacity to cause some change in this world.</li>
		<li>The SI unit of energy is the <b>Joule</b></li>
		<li>Energy can be observed in the form of <em>energy stores</em> and <em>energy transfers</em></li>

	<p><b>Energy Stores:</b> energy that is waiting to do work.</p>

<section>
		<p><b>Energy Transfers:</b> is energy that is in the process of moving from one energy store to another.</p>
	<p>There is normally some work done in the process</p>
	<img height="500" src="images/energy_transfer_1.png"></img>
</section>
<section>
	<p>Some ways energy can be transferred are by forces, electrical currents, heating, and by electromagnetic, sound and other waves</p>
	<img height="500" src="images/energy_transfers_in_hydroelectric.png"></img>
</section>
<section>
	<p>Energy transferred results in that amount of <b>work</b></p>
	<p><b>Work</b> means some change or effect in this world.</p>
	<p>The SI unit of work is <b>Joule</b> which is the same unit as energy</p>

</section>
<section>
	<p><b>Sankey diagrams</b> are a good data visualisation technique to visualize energy transfers in which the width of the arrows is proportional to the flow of the energy at that point.</p>

	<p>For work done <em>when a force moves an object</em>, we can use the equation: </p>
	
	<p>$$ \text{work done} = \text{force applied} \times \text{distance moved in the direction of force} $$</p>
	<p>$$ W = F d$$</p>
</section>
<section>
	<p>If all forces are in balance, there is no motion.</p>
	<img height="500" src="images/no_work_1.png"></img>
	<p>There is <em>no work</em> done when there is no motion.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<p>In some cases, there is motion, but still no work done.</p>
	<img height="500" src="images/no_work_2.png"></img>
	<p>A satellite orbiting the Earth <em>does no work</em></p>
</section>
<section>
	<p>This is because at every point, the satellite moves in a direction perpendicular to the direction of gravitational force</p>
	<img height="300" src="images/no_work_centripetal.png"></img>
	<p>So there is no movement in the direction of force applied</p>
	<p>So $$W = Fd = F \times 0 = 0 \; J$$</p>

<section>
	<p><b>Kinetic energy</b> is an energy transfer that occurs when an object is in motion.</p>
	<img height="250" src="images/motion.jpg"></img>
	<p>Kinetic energy of an object can be calculated by</p>
	<p>$$ \text{Kinetic energy} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{mass} \times \text{velocity}^2$$</p>
	<p>$$ E_k = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 $$</p>
</section>
<section>
	<p>When an object is raised, it gains an amount of <b>gravitational potential energy</b></p>
	<img height="400" src="images/gravitational_potential.png"></img>
	<p><b>Gravitational potential energy</b> is an energy store which is ready to do the work of <em>pulling the object closer to the Earth</em></p>
</section>
<section>
	<img height="300" src="images/gravitational_potential.png"></img>
	<p>The gravitational potential energy gained or lost by the object can be calculated by</p>
	<p>$$ \text{gravitational p.e} = \text{mass} \times \text{acc. due to gravity} \times \text{change in height} $$</p>
	<p>$$ E_p = m g \Delta h$$</p>
</section>
<section>
	<p>When <em>gravitational potential energy</em> is allowed to do work, it causes the object to fall down towards the Earth</p>
	<img height="400" src="images/potential_to_kinetic.png"></img>
	<p>This causes an increase in the objects <em>kinetic energy</em> in the downward direction</p>
</section>
<section>
	<p>The gravitational potential energy gained and lost <em>does not depend on the path taken.</em><p>
	<img height="400" src="images/independant_of_path.png"></img>
	<p>It only depends on the difference between initial and final heights</p>
</section>
<section>
	<p>In a pendulum, the energy transfers continuously between gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy</p>
	<img height="400" src="images/pendulum_energy.png"></img>
	<p>The <em>gravitational potential energy</em> is maximum at the ends of the arc</p>
	<p>The <em>kinetic energy</em> is maximum at the lowest point of the arc</p>
</section>
<section>
	<p>How fast an object does work is measured in its <b>power</b></p>
	<p><b>Power</b> is defined as the <em>work done per unit time</em></p>
	<p><b>Power</b> can also be defined as the <em>energy transferred per unit time</em></p>
	<p>$$ \text{power} = \frac{\text{Work}}{\text{time}} = \frac{\text{Energy transferred}}{\text{time}}$$</p>
	<p>$$ P = \frac{W}{t} =  \frac{\Delta E}{t}$$</p>
	<p>The SI unit of power is the <b>Watt</b> which is 1 joule per second</p>
</section>
<section>
	<p><b>Efficiency</b> is the ratio of useful energy output to the total energy input in a system or process.</p>
	<p>$$ \text{efficiency} = \frac{\text{useful energy output}}{\text{total energy input}} $$</p>
	<p>It can also be calculated based on the power</p>
	<p>$$ \text{efficiency} = \frac{\text{useful power output}}{\text{total power input}} $$</p>
	<p>There is no unit for efficiency, since it is just a number</p>

	<p>Coal power stations use the heat from fossil fuels to generate heat which is used to make steam in a boiler</p>
	<p>This steam drives a turbine connected to a generator which then generates electricity</p>
