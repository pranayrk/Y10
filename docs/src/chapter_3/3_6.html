	### 3.6: Pressure in liquids 

	* Pressure beneath a liquid surface depends on the depth and the density of
	the liquid.
		* The **greater the depth** in a given liquid, the **greater the pressure**. This is because as you increase in depth there is a greater weight of liquid above you.
		* At a given depth, the **greater the density** of the liquid, the **greater the
	pressure**. This is because a higher density liquid has a greater weight per unit volume. 
	* Liquid pressure acts equally in all directions.

	<h3>3.6: Pressure in liquids</h3>
	<p>Liquids are almost incompressible  (their volume cannot be reduced by squeezing) and they ‘pass on’
	any pressure applied to them.</p>
	<p>This fact is made use of in hydraulic machines.</p>

<section data-markdown>
	The pressure transmitted through the liquid is 
	$$ \text{pressure} = \frac{\text{force}}{\text{area}} = \frac{f}{a}$$
	This pressure caused by $f$ acts on a second piston of larger area $A$, producing an upward force, $$F = \text{pressure} × \text{area} = \frac{f}{a} \times A = f \times \frac{A}{a}$$
	Since $A$ is larger than $a$, $F$ must be larger than $f$


	$A/a$ is known as the **force multiplying factor**

	<p>A <b>hydraulic jack</b> has a platform on top of piston $B$ and is used in garages to lift cars.</p>
	<p>Both valves open only to the right and they allow $B$ to be raised a long way when piston $A$ moves up and down repeatedly.</p>

	<p>The pressure increases with depth and density.</p>
	<blockquote>
		$$ \begin{aligned}
		\text{liquid pressure} & = \text{density} \\ & \quad \times \text{acc. due to gravity} \\ & \quad \times \text{depth of liquid} \end{aligned}$$
