	### 3.5: Pressure

	* To make sense of some effects in which a force acts on an object we have to consider not only the force but also the area on which it acts. 
	* For example: 
		* Wearing skis prevents you sinking into soft snow because your weight is spread over a greater area.
		* A nail is designed with a small area of contact which allows the nail to be hammered into the wood easier.

	### 3.5: Pressure

	> $$ \text{pressure} = \displaystyle \frac{\text{force}}{\text{area}} $$
	> or 
	> $$ p = \displaystyle \frac{F}{A}$$

	The SI Unit of pressure is called **Pascal** ($Pa$).  
	However, because one $Pa$ is pretty small, the kiloPascal ($kPa$) and megaPascal ($mPa$) are more commonly used.

	### 3.5: Pressure
	**Workbook 3.5, 1.b.i**  
	Calculate the pressure under a block of mass $0.8\\;kg$ if it rests on a side of area $22\\;cm^2$

	**Workbook 3.5, 1.b.ii**  
	Calculate the weight of an object if it exerts a pressure of $20\\;Pa$ over an area of $0.4\\;m^2$

	**Workbook 3.5, 1.c**  
	A brick of mass $1.5\\;kg$ and dimensions $10\\;cm \times 10 \\; cm \times 20 \\; cm$ rests on the ground. 
	Calculate the maximum pressure in $N/cm^2$ that it can exert on the ground.
