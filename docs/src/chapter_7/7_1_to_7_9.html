	A light ray that travels from one medium to another along the normal is not refracted.
2 A light ray bends towards the normal when it enters an optically denser medium at an angle
(e.g. air to glass).
3 Conversely, a light ray bends away from the normal when it enters an optically less dense
medium at an angle (e.g. glass to air).
4 The incident ray, the normal and the refracted ray all lie in the same plane.

Law of Refraction:
For two given media, the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence, i, to the sine of the angle of
refraction, r is a constant.
sin i = constant
sin r
This is also known as Snell’s Law.

<section>
	The refractive index n is the ratio of the speeds of a wave in two different regions.
	Consider light travelling through a medium. The refractive index n of a medium is the ratio of the
speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in the medium.
n=c/v

The higher the value of the refractive index of a medium, the slower light travels in the medium.
For light travelling from vacuum to an optical medium, the constant ratio sin i is also known as the
sin r
refractive index n of that medium.

Given that the speed of light in vacuum is 3.0 × 108 m/s, calculate the speed of light in crown
glass of refractive index 1.52.

	2	␇Describe the formation of an optical image by a
	plane mirror, and give its characteristics, i.e. same
	size, same distance from mirror, virtual


	aracteristics of a plane mirror image:
• The image is of the same size as the object.
• The image is laterally inverted. The left-hand side of
the image appears as the right-hand side of the object
and vice versa.
• The image is upright.
• The image is virtual. It cannot be captured on a screen
and the light rays do not meet at the image position. This
is opposite to a real image.
• The image has the same distance from the mirror as
the object.
