				### 2.14: Moving in Circles

				* **Newton’s first law of motion:** An object will stay at rest or continue to move at constant velocity unless acted on by a resultant force.
				
				* Therefore, any object that is not moving in a constant velocity must have a resultant force on it.
				* When an object is moving in a circle, its velocity keeps changing.
				* The resultant force that causes the object to move in a circle is known as **centripetal force**

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
				### 2.14: Moving in Circles

				> Any centripetal force must continuously change direction so that it is always directed towards the centre of the circle. 

				* Centripetal forces always act perpendicularly to the direction of instantaneous velocity.

				or 

				* When resultant force is perpendicular to the direction of motion, the object follows a circular path.

				<section data-markdown>
				### 2.14: Moving in Circles

				The resultant force required to keep the object moving in a circle varies with speed and mass of the object, and the radius of the circle.
				* Increasing the speed $\implies$ more force required
				* Increasing radius $\implies$ less force required
				* Increasing mass $\implies$ more force required
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
				### 2.14: Moving in Circles

				* Many people identify a force acting outwards on them when they go around a circle
				* This force is often called **centrifugal force**.
				
				> Centrifugal force is *normally thought of* as the tendency of an object moving in a circle to travel away from the center of a circle.

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
				### 2.14: Moving in Circles
				##### Example of centrifugal force

				A passenger may feel that they are forced outwards against the side door of a car going quickly around a corner. 

				* **From the passenger's perspective:** this is sort of correct
				* **More correct perspective:** the car door is pushing inwards on the passenger, making them move around a corner.

					### 3.5: Pressure

					* To make sense of some effects in which a force acts on an object we have to consider not only the force but also the area on which it acts. 
					* For example: 
						* Wearing skis prevents you sinking into soft snow because your weight is spread over a greater area.
						* A nail is designed with a small area of contact which allows the nail to be hammered into the wood easier.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				### 3.5: Pressure

				> $$ \text{pressure} = \displaystyle \frac{\text{force}}{\text{area}} $$
				> or 
				> $$ p = \displaystyle \frac{F}{A}$$

				The SI Unit of pressure is called **Pascal** ($Pa$).  
				However, because one $Pa$ is pretty small, the kiloPascal ($kPa$) and megaPascal ($mPa$) are more commonly used.

					### 3.6: Pressure in liquids 
					
					* Pressure beneath a liquid surface depends on the depth and the density of
the liquid.
						* The **greater the depth** in a given liquid, the **greater the pressure**. This is because as you increase in depth there is a greater weight of liquid above you.
						* At a given depth, the **greater the density** of the liquid, the **greater the
pressure**. This is because a higher density liquid has a greater weight per unit volume. 
					* Liquid pressure acts equally in all directions.

					<h3>3.6: Pressure in liquids</h3>
					<p>Liquids are almost incompressible  (their volume cannot be reduced by squeezing) and they ‘pass on’
					any pressure applied to them.</p>
					<p>This fact is made use of in hydraulic machines.</p>
					<img src="images/hydraulic_machine.png"></img>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					The pressure transmitted through the liquid is 
					$$ \text{pressure} = \frac{\text{force}}{\text{area}} = \frac{f}{a}$$
					This pressure caused by $f$ acts on a second piston of larger area $A$, producing an upward force, $$F = \text{pressure} × \text{area} = \frac{f}{a} \times A = f \times \frac{A}{a}$$
Since $A$ is larger than $a$, $F$ must be larger than $f$


$A/a$ is known as the **force multiplying factor**

					### 4.1: Work and Energy

					* Energy exists in different forms. 
					* Stored energy is very useful and is called **potential energy**.
					* **Examples of energy stores:** Gravitational, elastic strain, chemical, electric, magnetic and nuclear
					* **Examples of energy transfer:** kinetic energy, electrical energy, thermal energy, radiant energy, wave energy
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 4.1: Work and Energy
					##### Stores of Energy

					* A moving object has **kinetic energy**: The faster an object moves, the greater its kinetic energy.
					* If you lift an object upwards, you give it **gravitational potential energy**.
					* Fuels such as coal or petrol are stores of **chemical energy**. 
					* Batteries are also stores of chemical energy.
					* Uranium is an example of a nuclear fuel, which is a store of **nuclear energy**. 
					* If you stretch a rubber band, it becomes a store of **strain energy**, also known as **elastic energy**.
					* If you heat an object so that it gets hotter, you are giving energy to its atoms. The energy stored in a hot object is called **internal energy**.
					* If you get close to a hot object, you may feel **thermal energy** coming from it.

					### 4.1: Work and Energy
					> When anything changes, energy is transferred.

					* This energy which is transferred to an object to cause some change is called **work**.
					* The SI unit of work is the **Joule** (J)

					> $$\text{work done} = \text{energy transferred}$$

					> $$W = \Delta E$$

					### 4.1: Work and Energy

					* **Mechanical work** is done when a force moves something.
					* No work is done *in the scientific sense* by someone standing still holding a heavy pile of books: an upward force is exerted, but no motion results.
					* The amount of work done $W$ depends on the size of the force $F$ applied and the distance $d$ it moves.

					<p>In physics, no work is done if the object does not move</p>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 4.1: Work and Energy
					For **mechanical work** in particular, we can use the following equation:

					> $$ \begin{aligned} \text{work done} & = \text{force} \times \text{distance moved in the}  \\\\ & \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \text{ direction of force} \end{aligned} $$
					> or 
					> $$ W = F \times d$$

					* Calculate the work done on the trolley
					* Explain what happened to the mechanical work done

					**Question:** A car moving in a straight line with $2.0 × 10^5 \\;J$ of kinetic energy is brought to a
stop by a constant resistive force of $4.0 × 10^3\\; N$. What is the stopping distance?

					### 4.2: Energy Transfers
					 When anything changes, energy is transformed.

					> The **principle of conservation of energy** states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be transferred.

					* The principle of conservation of energy tells us that we can account for all the energy that is transferred in any process.
					* Some useful energy is always lost as useless energy in the surroundings

					### 4.3: Calculating PE and KE
					* Potential energy is the energy an object has because of its position or condition.
					* **Gravitational potential energy** $E_P$ is energy possessed by a mass because of its position in a gravitational field.
					* When a mass is moved away from the Earth: 
						* the work done on the mass results in an increase in gravitational potential energy $\Delta E_P$
					* When a mass moves towards the Earth work is done by the field on the mass:
						* results in a decrease in gravitational potential energy (maybe it is transferred to kinetic energy).	
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 4.3: Calculating PE and KE

					* Normally we use changes in gravitational potential energy because most points on the surface of the Earth are not considered to have zero gravitational potential energy.
					* An object above the Earth’s surface is considered to have gained an amount of gravitational potential energy equal to the work that has been done against gravity by the force used to raise it. 
					* To lift an object of mass m through a vertical height $\Delta h$ at a place where the Earth’s gravitational field strength is $g$ needs a force equal and opposite to the weight $mg$ of the body. 
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 4.3: Calculating PE and KE

					Using the equation $W = F \times d$, we can find:

					> $$\text{change in g.p.e} = \Delta E_p = mg \Delta h$$


					When $m$ is in $kg$, $g$ in $m/s^2$ and $Δh$ in $m$: then $\Delta E_p$ is in $J$.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>4.3: Calculating PE and KE</h3>
					<p>If you lift a mass of $3\; kg$ vertically through $2\; m$, you have to exert a vertically upward force equal to the weight of the body</p>
					<p>So work done is $30\; N \times 2\; m = 60\; N m = 60 \;J$.</p>

					Taking $g = 9.8 N/kg$, calculate the potential energy gained by a 0.1 kg (100 g) mass raised vertically by $1 m$. Calculate the gravitational potential energy gained by a $0.2 kg$ mass raised vertically by $2 m$. 
					Calculate the gravitational potential energy lost by a $0.4 kg$ mass which falls vertically by $3 m$.
				</section>

				<section>
					How much work is done when a mass of 3 kg
(g = 9.8 N/kg) is lifted vertically through 6 m?
7 A hiker climbs a hill 300 m high. If she has a mass
of 51 kg, calculate the work she does in lifting her
body to the top of the hill.
8 An electric motor does 80 J of work in lifting
a box vertically upwards through 5 m.
Calculate the weight of the box.
				</section>
				<section>
					The minimum force needed to lift an object is equal to its weight. There would
then be no resultant force on it and it could be lifted at a constant velocity. Any
greater force will produce an acceleration upwards.

If an object is raised the same vertical height but at an angle less than 90° to
the horizontal surface (along a slope for example), less force will be needed,
but the distance moved will be greater. If there is no friction, the work done
will be the same.

					A mass m at height Δh above the ground has
gravitational potential energy = mgΔh (Figure
1.7.8). When an object falls, its speed increases
and it gains kinetic energy at the expense of its
gravitational potential energy. If it starts from rest
and air resistance is negligible, the kinetic energy
it has gained on reaching the ground equals the
gravitational potential energy lost by the mass
Ek = ΔEp
or
1 mv2 = mgΔh
2
where v is the speed of the mass when it reaches
the ground.

					### 4.3: Calculating PE and KE
					* Kinetic energy is the energy an object has because of its motion. 
					Work has to be done to make objects move, or move faster. So that, all moving
masses have energy because of their motion. This is called kinetic energy.

					* For an object of mass m travelling with velocity v

					> $$\text{kinetic energy} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{mass} \times \text{velocity}^2$$
					> or
					> $$E_k = \frac{1}{2} \times m \times v^2$$

					* If mass is in $kg$ and velocity is in $m/s$, then kinetic energy is in $J$.

					Question: A football of mass $0.4 kg$ moves with a speed of $20 \;m/s$. 
					* Calculate the kinetic energy of the football.
					* Calculate the momentum of the football.
				</section>

				<section>In the case of a pendulum (Figure 1.7.9),
kinetic and gravitational potential energy are
interchanged continually. The energy of the bob
is all gravitational potential energy at the end
of the swing and all kinetic energy as it passes
through its central position. In other positions it
has both gravitational potential and kinetic energy.
Eventually all the energy is transferred to thermal
energy as a result of overcoming air resistance.

					The trolley of books pushed by the librarian in Worked Example 6D has a mass of 80 kg. After
pushing the trolley over a horizontal distance, he reaches the bottom of a gentle incline with a
certain speed v. The vertical height of the incline is 0.5 m. In order to maintain the same speed v
up the incline, the librarian exerts a much larger force of 40 N to push the trolley over a distance
of 10 m along the incline.
Assuming negligible air resistance and frictional effects at the moving parts of the trolley,
(a) calculate the work done by the 40 N force on the trolley along the incline;
(b) calculate the gain in gravitational potential energy of the trolley.
(Take g = 10 N/kg)
