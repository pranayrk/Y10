				### 2.14: Moving in Circles

				* **Newton’s first law of motion:** An object will stay at rest or continue to move at constant velocity unless acted on by a resultant force.
				
				* Therefore, any object that is not moving in a constant velocity must have a resultant force on it.
				* When an object is moving in a circle, its velocity keeps changing.
				* The resultant force that causes the object to move in a circle is known as **centripetal force**

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
				### 2.14: Moving in Circles

				> Any centripetal force must continuously change direction so that it is always directed towards the centre of the circle. 

				* Centripetal forces always act perpendicularly to the direction of instantaneous velocity.

				or 

				* When resultant force is perpendicular to the direction of motion, the object follows a circular path.

				<section data-markdown>
				### 2.14: Moving in Circles

				The resultant force required to keep the object moving in a circle varies with speed and mass of the object, and the radius of the circle.
				* Increasing the speed $\implies$ more force required
				* Increasing radius $\implies$ less force required
				* Increasing mass $\implies$ more force required
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
				### 2.14: Moving in Circles

				* Many people identify a force acting outwards on them when they go around a circle
				* This force is often called **centrifugal force**.
				
				> Centrifugal force is *normally thought of* as the tendency of an object moving in a circle to travel away from the center of a circle.

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
				### 2.14: Moving in Circles
				##### Example of centrifugal force

				A passenger may feel that they are forced outwards against the side door of a car going quickly around a corner. 

				* **From the passenger's perspective:** this is sort of correct
				* **More correct perspective:** the car door is pushing inwards on the passenger, making them move around a corner.

					> **Principle of moments:** The principle of moments states when a body is in equilibrium, the *sum of the clockwise moments* about any point equals the *sum of the anticlockwise moments* about the same point.

						* There is no resultant force on the object
						* There is no resultant moment on the object

					### 3.5: Pressure

					* To make sense of some effects in which a force acts on an object we have to consider not only the force but also the area on which it acts. 
					* For example: 
						* Wearing skis prevents you sinking into soft snow because your weight is spread over a greater area.
						* A nail is designed with a small area of contact which allows the nail to be hammered into the wood easier.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				### 3.5: Pressure

				> $$ \text{pressure} = \displaystyle \frac{\text{force}}{\text{area}} $$
				> or 
				> $$ p = \displaystyle \frac{F}{A}$$

				The SI Unit of pressure is called **Pascal** ($Pa$).  
				However, because one $Pa$ is pretty small, the kiloPascal ($kPa$) and megaPascal ($mPa$) are more commonly used.

					### 3.6: Pressure in liquids 
					
					* Pressure beneath a liquid surface depends on the depth and the density of
the liquid.
						* The **greater the depth** in a given liquid, the **greater the pressure**. This is because as you increase in depth there is a greater weight of liquid above you.
						* At a given depth, the **greater the density** of the liquid, the **greater the
pressure**. This is because a higher density liquid has a greater weight per unit volume. 
					* Liquid pressure acts equally in all directions.

					<h3>3.6: Pressure in liquids</h3>
					<p>Liquids are almost incompressible  (their volume cannot be reduced by squeezing) and they ‘pass on’
					any pressure applied to them.</p>
					<p>This fact is made use of in hydraulic machines.</p>
					<img src="images/hydraulic_machine.png"></img>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					The pressure transmitted through the liquid is 
					$$ \text{pressure} = \frac{\text{force}}{\text{area}} = \frac{f}{a}$$
					This pressure caused by $f$ acts on a second piston of larger area $A$, producing an upward force, $$F = \text{pressure} × \text{area} = \frac{f}{a} \times A = f \times \frac{A}{a}$$
Since $A$ is larger than $a$, $F$ must be larger than $f$


$A/a$ is known as the **force multiplying factor**
