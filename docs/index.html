	### What will be on Paper 6?

	You may be asked questions on the following experimental contexts:

	* measurement of physical quantities such as length or volume or force
	* springs and balances
	* timing motion or oscillations
	* optics equipment such as mirrors, prisms and lenses
	* cooling and heating
	* electric circuits
	* procedures using simple apparatus, in situations where the method may not be familiar to you.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### Tips for Paper 6
	* When plotting a graph
		* choose the scales so that the plots occupy more than half of the graph grid. 
		* You should always use a sharp pencil 
		* plot small, neat, accurately placed crosses. 
		* Then draw a neat thin best-fit line.
	* You should understand that if $y$ is proportional to $x$ then the graph will be a straight line through the origin.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### Tips for Paper 6

	* Diagrams should be drawn with care using a sharp pencil.
	* Column headings in tables of readings must be headed with the quantity and unit
	* Graph axes are labelled in the same way.
	* Final answers should be given to *two or three significant figures*.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### Tips for Paper 6

	* When carrying out practical work there are usually measurements that are in some way difficult to take in spite of taking great care. 
		* You should comment about these difficulties when asked about precautions taken to improve accuracy.
	* If you are asked to justify a statement that you have made it must be justified by reference to the readings. A theoretical justification in a practical test will not gain marks.
	* **Identify the sensitivity of the apparatus** and record the readings per the sensitivity of the apparatus
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### Tips for Paper 6

	* Include a good diagram, key factor of investigation, proper steps, independent dependant and control variables along with a solid conclusion
	* Its always good to add a formula in the conclusion. 
	* Go though past papers and see the expected answers. Usually they tend to overlap a lot

	### Skills regarding handling the experiment

	* How to measure the length/thickness/diameter using the suitable tool?
	* Measuring length
	* Measuring the thickness of thin object
	* Measuring the diameter of a cylinder or a sphere
	* Measuring the diameter of ball bearings
	* Measuring circumference of a cylindrical-shaped object (cup, test tube...)
	* How to check that the ruler is vertical/horizontal to the bench?
</section>

	### Skills regarding handling the experiment

	* How to measure the volume of
		* Liquids
		* Regular solids
		* Irregular solids
		* Measuring cylinder
		* Displacement can
	* How to measure the mass?
	* How to measure the time?
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### Examples of Precautions to Take

	* Measuring cylinder
    		* line of sight below meniscus
    		* look perpendicularly

	* Pivot
    		* loads might obscure the scale
    		* Difficult to find best balance position
    		* Difficult to find center of load.
    		* Load might slip off the ruler


		<!--


Temp precaution:

    stir before reading

    Read thermometer perpendicularly

    Give enough time for reading to stop rising

    Donâ€™t let thermometer touch beaker (to measure temp of liquid NOT beaker)


Ray tracing:

    Make sure pins not bent/straight/vertical

    Look at base of pin

    Place pins ~5 cm apart

    Outline of block might be bigger than actual block

    Difficult to draw thin accurate lines

    Difficult to see pins clearly

Light:

    move lens slowly back and forth to get focus image

    Dark room
    
    Make sure screen, object and lamp are all vertical

    Clamp rule to bench

    10-45 cm distance of u

	### Paper 6 questions for General Physics

	* Measurement of physical quantities
	* Springs and Balances
	* Timing, Motion or Oscillation

	### Spring Experiment

	A student is investigating how the material of a spring affects its behaviour when stretched.
	The following apparatus is available to the student:
	* wires of different thickness, length and material
	* a set of 10 g masses and a set of 100 g masses, both with hangers
	* a wooden rod approximately 1 cm in diameter
	* other standard laboratory equipment.

	Plan an experiment which will enable you to test the extension of springs made from different
types of wire.

<section>
	<h3>Spring Experiment</h3>

	<h5>In your plan, you should include</h5>
	<p><b>1. instructions for making a spring from the wire that is provided</b></p>
	<p class="fragment">springs made by winding wire around rod (or similar)</p>
	<p><b>2. what you will measure</b></p>
	<p class="fragment">take different readings under different loads for each spring material</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h3>Spring Experiment</h3>
	<p><b>3. instructions for carrying out the experiment</b></p>
	<ul>

		<li class="fragment">apply load, measure length / extension of spring</li>
		<li class="fragment">repeat for spring(s) of different material</li>
		<li class="fragment">record results in suitable annotated table / bar chart / graph</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><b>4. the variables you will keep the same to ensure the comparison is a fair test</b></p>

	<h3>Spring Experiment</h3>
	<p><b>5. any precaution which should be taken or difficulty which might occur</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li class="fragment">clamp the retort stand or it might topple</li>
		<li class="fragment">use small loads or spring might overstretch</li>
		<li class="fragment">loads need to apply force smoothly / slowly</li>
		<li class="fragment">have a workable arrangement for applying load to spring (e.g. small loop at end of spring)</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>6. Describe how you will conduct the experiment and ensure accuracy of results</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li class="fragment">trial experiment to find (range of) loads to use</li>
		<li class="fragment">how to determine extension of spring</li>
		<li class="fragment">repeat each reading and take average</li>
