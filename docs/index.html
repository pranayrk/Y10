	<h3>Solid</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The distance between the particles is small, so solids have a <em>high density</em> and are <em>incompressible.</em></li>
		<li>As they are close together, the particles in solids have strong attractive forces between them.</li>
		<li>That is why solids have a <em>fixed volume</em>, <em>a fixed shape</em> and <em>cannot flow</em>.</li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section>
	<img height="300" src="images/solid_liquid_gas.png"></img>
	<h3>Liquid</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The distance between the particles in liquids is slightly greater than in solids and the attractive forces are not as strong.</li>
		<li>That is why liquids are <em>slightly less dense</em> but are still <em>incompressible</em> and have a <em>fixed volume</em>.</li>
		<li>That is why liquids <em>can flow</em>, and do not have a <em>fixed shape</em> but take the shape of their container.</li>

	<ul>
		<li>The <b>Kinetic theory of matter</b> says that matter is made of tiny particles constantly in motion.</li>
		<li>Particles have kinetic energy because they are moving or vibrating</li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section>
	<img src="images/brownian_motion_diagram.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li>A key piece of evidence that was used to prove the kinetic theory of matter is <b>Brownian motion</b></li>
		<li>Brownian motion refers to the random movement of microscopic particles in a fluid due to the collisions by the molecules of the fluid.</li>
		<li>Examples of microscopic particles are pollen grains and smoke particles.</li>
		<li>We can only see microscopic particles under the microscope as the molecules are too small to be seen.</li>
	</ul>

	<h5>Explanation of Brownian Motion</h5>
	<h6>Air consists mainly of nitrogen molecules $N_2$, and oxygen molecules $O_2$. These molecules are too small to be seen under the microscope. A smoke particle is a solid lump of many carbon atoms. When light is shone on a mixture of smoke particles in air, the smoke particles can be seen as tiny specks of reflected light. There are millions of molecules in the air moving at high speeds in all directions. This means that
there are many collisions on each smoke particle happening all the time. The smoke particle is
constantly pushed one way and then another. As we cannot see the molecules, the smoke particles
appear to be constantly moving small distances in a random path.</h6>
</section>
<section>
	<img height="400" src="images/brownian_motion_experiment.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li>To observe Brownian motion in the lab, we use a <b>smoke cell</b> which is a transparent box with smoke trapped inside</li>
		<li>Shining a light through the cell and observing it under a microscope, we can see the smoke particles as <em>tiny bright specks of light following a zig-zag random motion</em>.</li>
	</ul>

	<img height="250" src="images/solids_liquids_gases_vibration.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li>The <b>kinetic energy</b> of particles in a substance depends on how fast the particles of the substances are moving or vibrating.</li>
		<li>The <b>potential energy</b> of particles in a substance arises mostly from intramolecular bonds.</li>
	</ul>
	<blockquote>
		$$\text{Internal Energy} = \text{Kinetic Energy} + \text{Potential Energy}$$
	</blockquote>
</section>
<section>
	<img src="images/temperature_internal_energy.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li>If you increase the internal energy by heating a substance, either:
			<ul>
				<li>the particles move faster (which <em>increases the total kinetic energy</em>)</li>
				<li>or the intramolecular bonds are weakened/broken (which <em>increases the total potential energy</em>).</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>You can measure the kinetic energy in particles with a thermometer. It is usually not possible to measure the internal energy of particles.</li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section>
	<img src="images/solids_liquids_gases_vibration.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li>The lowest temperature where the particles have the least kinetic energy occurs at $–273^\circ C$.</li>
		<li>This temperature is also known as <b>absolute zero</b>.</li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section>
	<h4>The Celsius Scale</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The Celsius scale is made by setting two important temperatures known as <b>fixed points</b> and then making equally spaced divisions between those points. The fixed points for the Celsius scale are:
			<ul>
				<li>The melting  point of pure ice at atmospheric pressure. This was set as $0^\circ C$</li>
				<li>The boiling point of pure water at atmospheric pressure. This was set as $100^\circ C$</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>The Kelvin Scale</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The Kelvin scale uses the fixed point absolute zero ($−273^\circ C$) which is the lowest temperate possible. This is set as $0\;K$</li>
		<li>The spacing of the divisions of the Celsius scale remains the same in the Kelvin scale.</li>
	</ul>

	<blockquote>
		$$\text{temp in K} = \text{temp in $^\circ$C} + 273$$ 
		$$\text{temp in $^\circ C$} = \text{temp in K} - 273$$

<section>
	<img height="400" src="images/heating_liquids.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li>According to the kinetic theory of matter, the particles of solids and liquids are in constant vibration.</li>
		<li>When heated they vibrate faster and force each other a little further apart.</li>
		<li>This results in the object expanding when they are heated. This is known as <b>thermal expansion</b>.</li>
	</ul>

	<h5>Uses/Effects of Thermal Expansion</h5>
	<img height="400" src="images/axle_fit.png"></img>
	<img height="400" src="images/axle_fitting.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li>The axles have are shrunk by cooling in liquid nitrogen at −196°C until the gear wheels can be slipped on to them.</li>
		<li>On regaining normal temperature, the axles expand to give a very tight fit.</li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section>
	<h5>Uses/Effects of Thermal Expansion</h5>
	<img height="300" src="images/gaps_in_railway.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li>Railway lines and bridges are subject to a lot of heating in the summer.</li>
		<li>If the expansion is resisted, large forces are created which could break the rail line.</li>
		<li>Gaps are normally left in railway lines and bridges to account for expansion in summer.</li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<h5>Uses/Effects of Thermal Expansion</h5>
	<img height="250" src="images/bimetallic_strip.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li>Some materials expand more than others. For example, copper expands more than iron when it is heated.</li>
	<li>If equal lengths copper and iron, are fixed together so that they cannot move separately, they form a <b>bimetallic strip</b>.</li>
	<li>When this strip is heated, the copper expands more than the iron. Since they are fixed together, this difference in expansion causes the strip bends with copper on the outside.</li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<h5>Uses of the Bimetallic Strip</h5>
	<img height="400" src="images/bimetallic_strip_fire_alarm.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li>Heat from the fire makes the bimetallic strip bend with the copper on the outside.</li>
		<li>This makes the strip come in contact and complete the electrical circuit, which rings the fire alarm bell.</li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section>
	<h5>Uses of the Bimetallic Strip</h5>
	<p>A <b>thermostat</b> keeps the temperature of a room or an appliance constant.</p>
	<img height="300" src="images/bimetallic_strip_iron_box.png"></img>
	<ul>
	<li>When the iron reaches the required temperature the strip bends down, breaks the circuit at the contacts and switches off the heater.</li>
	<li>After cooling a little, the strip remakes contact and turns the heater on again.</li>
	</li>
</section>
<section>
	<h5>Anomalous Expansion of Ice</h5>
	<img height="300" src="images/ice_water_graph.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li>Most materials expand when they are heated, and shrink when they are cooled.</li>
		<li>Surprisingly, when water is cooled below $4^\circ C$ it expands till it becomes ice.</li>
		<li>This results in every $100\; cm^3$ of water becoming $109\; cm^3$ of ice and causes ice to float on top of water.</li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<img height="300" src="images/gas_laws.jpeg"></img>
	<ul>
	<li>Just as solids and liquids expand when they are heated, gases try to expand when they are heated.</li>
	<li>The bounds of the container do not allow gases to expand, so this leads to a change in either pressure or temperature.</li>
	<li>The behaviour of a gas can be modelled considering the interdependance of <b>pressure, temperature, and volume</b>.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>This behaviour for <em>an individual atom</em> can be modelled by Newton's laws and the law of conservation of momentum.</li>

		<li>The force from one collision is very small but with so many particles colliding all the time, the force exerted can be large.</li>
		<li>Since its is inconvenient to model every atom in a gas, we normally consider the <em>average force per unit area</em> of all these collisions as the <b>pressure</b> of the gas on the container.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
	<li>Consider you have some gas in a container, and then reduce the volume of the container.</li>
	<li>This reduces the distance that each particle has to travel before hitting the wall of the container.</li>
	<li>This means that the <em>particles collide with the wall of the container more frequently.</em></li>
	<li>This increase in the number of collisions increases the pressure of the gas on the container.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><b>Experiment to examine the effect of pressure on volume</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Increasing the pressure on the oil with the foot pump will cause the oil column to rise.</li>
		<li>A <b>Bourdon gauge</b> will let us record this pressure.</li>
		<li>We can measure the change in volume by measuring the change in height of the air column (since the tube is a cylinder, the radius stays the same).</li>
	</ul>
</section>

	<img height="300" src="images/pressure_vs_volume_graph.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li>We can notice that if we were to plot a graph of $P$ vs $V$, it would be a curved line (as on the left).</li>
		<li>To make the graph easier  to understand, we plot a graph of $P$ vs $\displaystyle \frac{1}{V}$, which will give us a straight line (as on the right).</li>
	</ul>

	<p><b>Note:</b> The graph is an <b>isothermal</b> graph, which means that the temperature at all points in the graph is kept the same.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<img height="300" src="images/pressure_vs_volume_graph.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li>We recall that a straight line in a graph indicates <em>proportionality</em>.</li>
		<li>Looking at the graph on the right, we can then conclude $P \propto \frac{1}{V}$.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>$\begin{aligned}
	P \propto \frac{1}{V} & \implies P = \text{constant} \times \frac{1}{V}
	\\ &  \implies P \times V = \text{constant}
	\end{aligned}$</p>
	<p>The equation $PV = \text{constant}$ is known as <b>Boyle's Law</b>.</p>

</section>
<section>
	<ul>
		<li>When a gas is heated, the <em>average kinetic energy</em> of its particles increase.</li>
		<li>This means on average, the particles move faster, and when they strike the wall of the container, they have a larger force.</li>
		<li>If the container is flexible, <em>this increased force will cause the container to expand outwards</em>, increasing its volume.</li>
	</ul>

	<img height="300" src="images/volume_temperature_graph.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li>We use the recorded values and plot a graph of $T$ vs $V$.</li>
		<li>We will find that the data points form a straight line graph which indicates $V \propto T$.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>$V \propto T \implies V = \text{constant} \times T \implies \frac{V}{T} = \text{constant}$</p>	
	<p>The equation $\displaystyle \frac{V}{T} = \text{constant}$ is known as <b>Charles' Law</b>.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<img height="300" src="images/how_kelvin_0_was_found.png"></img>
	<ul>
	<li>If we conduct this experiment for multiple different pressures, and plot each set of data points on the same graph, we will get multiple lines.</li>
	<li>Extending these lines backward, we can see that all the lines will meet at the same point where the volume is 0.</li>
	<li>The temperature at this point is the temperature $-273.15^\circ C$. This is how absolute zero was discovered.</li>

		<li>The process by which heat is directly transmitted through the material of a substance when there is a difference of temperature is known as <b>thermal conduction</b>.</li>
		<li>Molecules in hotter objects have more kinetic energy and move faster.</li>
		<li>These molecules collide with adjacent molecules, transferring their kinetic energy (lattice vibrations).</li>

	<img height="200" src="images/conduction_in_metals.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li>The composition of a material affects how well it conducts heat.</li>

		<li>The particles in liquids and gases are spaced further apart than those in solids.</li>
		<li>The collisions between the particles are less frequent in liquids and gases.</li>
		<li>This means that the transfer of kinetic energy from the fast-moving particles to neighbouring particles is slower.</li>

		<li>Liquids and gases get hotter by convection.</li>
		<li>Convection is the transfer of thermal energy in a fluid (liquid or gas) by means of convection currents due to a difference in density.</li>
	</ul>
	<h6>Convection currents form because of the difference in density in water when
heated. When the water at the bottom of the flask is heated, it expands.
The expanded water is less dense than the surrounding water because there
is more space between the molecules. The warmer, less dense water rises.
It cools down at the top of the flask, become denser and sinks down again.
This process repeats until the whole flask of water is heated up.</h6>

	**Specific heat capacity** $c$ is defined as the amount of thermal energy required to raise the temperature of a $1\\;kg$ of a substance by $1^\circ C$ (or $1 \\;K$).
	> This gives us the equation for specific heat capacity:
	>	$$c = \frac{\Delta E}{m \Delta \theta}$$

	> The equation can be rearranged as $\Delta E = mc\Delta \theta$.

	The SI unit of specific heat capacity is $J/(kg K)$ or $J/(kg^\circ C)$.

		<li>Before switching on the heater, we record the mass $m$ of the block using a weighing scale and record the temperature of the block.</li>
		<li>The heater is of known power $P$. Switching on the heater for a time period $t$, we can calculate the energy supplied to the block as $E = P \times t$.</li>

	* The **specific latent heat of fusion (lf)** of a substance is the quantity of heat needed to change $1\\;kg$ of a solid to liquid.
	* In general, the quantity of heat $\Delta E$ needed to change a mass $m$ from solid to liquid is given by
	$$ \Delta E = m × lf$$
	* The SI unit of specific latent heat is measured in $J/kg$.

	* The **latent heat of fusion** for water is $33.5 \times 10^4 J/kg$.
	* The **latent heat of vaporization** for water is $22.6 \times 10^5 J/kg$


	* To change $1 \\;kg$ of water at $100^\circ C$ to steam at $100^\circ C$ needs over five times as much heat as is needed to raise the temperature of $1 \\;kg$ of water at $0^\circ C$ to water at $100^\circ C$.
