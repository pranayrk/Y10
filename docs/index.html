	### 4.1: Work and Energy

	* Energy exists in different forms. 
	* Stored energy is very useful and is called **potential energy**.
	* **Examples of energy stores:** Gravitational, elastic strain, chemical, electric, magnetic and nuclear
	* **Examples of energy transfer:** kinetic energy, electrical energy, thermal energy, radiant energy, wave energy
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 4.1: Work and Energy
	##### Stores of Energy

	* A moving object has **kinetic energy**: The faster an object moves, the greater its kinetic energy.
	* If you lift an object upwards, you give it **gravitational potential energy**.
	* Fuels such as coal or petrol are stores of **chemical energy**. 
	* Batteries are also stores of chemical energy.
	* Uranium is an example of a nuclear fuel, which is a store of **nuclear energy**. 
	* If you stretch a rubber band, it becomes a store of **strain energy**, also known as **elastic energy**.
	* If you heat an object so that it gets hotter, you are giving energy to its atoms. The energy stored in a hot object is called **internal energy**.
	* If you get close to a hot object, you may feel **thermal energy** coming from it.

	### 4.1: Work and Energy
	> When anything changes, energy is transferred.

	* This energy which is transferred to an object to cause some change is called **work**.
	* The SI unit of work is the **Joule** (J)

	> $$\text{work done} = \text{energy transferred}$$
	> or 
	> $$W = \Delta E$$

	### 4.1: Work and Energy

	* **Mechanical work** is done when a force moves something.
	* No work is done *in the scientific sense* by someone standing still holding a heavy pile of books: an upward force is exerted, but no motion results.
	* The amount of work done $W$ depends on the size of the force $F$ applied and the distance $d$ it moves.
</section>

	<p>In physics, no work is done if the object does not move</p>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 4.1: Work and Energy
	For **mechanical work** in particular, we can use the following equation:

	> $$ \begin{aligned} \text{work done} & = \text{force} \times \text{distance moved in the}  \\\\ & \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \text{ direction of force} \end{aligned} $$
	> or 
	> $$ W = F \times d$$

	**Question:** A librarian pushes a trolley of books for shelving. The horizontal force $F$ exerted by the librarian on the trolley is $8\\; N$ and the trolley moves a distance of $5\\; m$ in the direction of the force.
	* Calculate the work done on the trolley
	* Explain what happened to the mechanical work done

	**Question:** A car moving in a straight line with $2.0 × 10^5 \\;J$ of kinetic energy is brought to a
	stop by a constant resistive force of $4.0 × 10^3\\; N$. What is the stopping distance?

	### 4.2: Energy Transfers
	When anything changes, energy is transformed.

	> The **principle of conservation of energy** states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be transferred.

	* The principle of conservation of energy tells us that we can account for all the energy that is transferred in any process.
	* Some useful energy is always lost as useless energy in the surroundings

	### 4.3: Calculating PE and KE

	* Potential energy is the energy an object has because of its position or condition.
	* **Gravitational potential energy** $E_P$ is energy possessed by a mass because of its position in a gravitational field.
	* When a mass is moved away from the Earth: 
		* the work done on the mass against the field
		* increase in gravitational potential energy $\Delta E_P$
	* When a mass moves towards the Earth:
		* the work is done by the field on the mass
		* results in a decrease in gravitational potential energy
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 4.3: Calculating PE and KE

	* We use $\Delta E_p$ because most points on the surface of the Earth are not considered to have zero gravitational potential energy.
	* To lift an object of mass $m$ through a vertical height $\Delta h$ in a gravitational field with strength $g$ needs a force equal and opposite to the weight $mg$ of the body. 
</section>
<section>
	<h3>4.3: Calculating PE and KE</h3>
	<p>If you lift a mass of $3\; kg$ vertically through $2\; m$, you have to exert a vertically upward force equal to the weight of the body</p>
	<p>So work done is $30\; N \times 2\; m = 60\; N m = 60 \;J$.</p>

<section data-markdown>
	### 4.3: Calculating PE and KE

	Using the equation $W = F \times d$, we can find:

	> $$\text{change in g.p.e} = \text{mass} \times g \times \text{change in height}$$
	> or 
	> $$\Delta E_p = mg \Delta h$$

	If $m$ is in $kg$ and $g$ in $m/s^2$ and $Δh$ in $m$,

	then $\Delta E_p$ is in $J$.

	### 4.3: Calculating PE and KE

	* You can raise an object in two ways:
		* straight up at an angle of $90^\circ$ from horizontal
		* at an angle less than $90^\circ$ to the horizontal surface
	* less force will be needed, but the distance moved will be greater. 
	* If there is no friction, the *work done will be the same*.

<section data-markdown>
	### 4.3: Calculating PE and KE

	* **Kinetic energy** is the energy an object has because of its motion. 
	* Work has to be done to make objects move, or move faster. 

	* For an object of mass m travelling with velocity v

	> $$\text{kinetic energy} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{mass} \times \text{velocity}^2$$
	> or
	> $$E_k = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$$

	* If mass is in $kg$ and velocity is in $m/s$, then kinetic energy is in $J$.

	### 4.3: Calculating PE and KE

	* A mass above the ground has gravitational potential energy $mg\Delta h$ 
	* When it falls, its speed increases and:
		* it gains kinetic energy

	* If it starts from rest and air resistance is negligible: 
		* the kinetic energy gained on reaching the ground equals the gravitational potential energy lost
		* $E_k = \Delta E_p$

	### 4.3: Calculating PE and KE
	* In the case of a pendulum, kinetic and gravitational potential energy are interchanged continually. 
	* The energy of the bob of the pendulum is:
		* fully gravitational potential energy at the end of the swing
		* all kinetic energy as it passes through its central position
	* In other positions it has both gravitational potential and kinetic energy.
	* Eventually all the energy is transferred to thermal energy as a result of overcoming air resistance.

	### 4.4: Efficiency and Power

	* The **power** of a thing is the work it does per second, i.e. the rate at which it does work.
	* This is the same as the rate at which it transfers energy from one store to another.
	* The SI unit of power is the **Watt** ($W$) and is a rate of working of $1J$ per second

	* The efficiency of a device is the percentage
of the energy supplied to it that is usefully
transferred.
* Based on the principle of conservation of energy,
total energy input = useful energy output + wasted energy output.
	$$\text{efficiency} = useful work done/total energy input * 100%$$

	or

	$$efficiency = useful work done/total energy input * 100%$$


	* A device is efficient if it transfers energy mainly
to useful stores and the lost energy is small.
	or

	$$efficiency = useful power output/total power input$
