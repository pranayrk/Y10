					<p><b>Galileo Galilei, 1564 – 1642</b></p>

					<p> <b>Speed</b> is a <em>scalar</em> quantity that is a measure of the rate of change of distance.</p>
					<p><b>Unit:</b> If distance is measured in metres and time in seconds, speed is measured in metres per second ($m/s$)</p>

				* A *scalar* is a quantity which is the answer to the question "how much"
				* A *vector* is a quantity which answers the questions "how much" + "in which direction"
				* **Displacement** is the distance an object travels in a particular direction. 
				* **Velocity** is the speed an object travels in a particular direction.
			
				> $\text{Velocity} = \displaystyle\frac{\text{displacement}}{\text{time taken}}$

					<h3>2.3 MOTION: Recording Motion</h3>
					<h4>For Self Study</h4>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.4 MOTION: Free Fall
					* **Acceleration of free fall** is the *constant* downward acceleration applied on an object which makes it fall down
					* This acceleration is represented by the symbol $g$. 
						* On Earth, the acceleration measures to be $9.8m/s^2$. 
						* On the moon, it is $1.62m/s^2$
						* On Jupiter, it is $24.9m/s^2$
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.4 MOTION: Free Fall
					**Learners Book, 2.5 Page 2**  
					A ball is thrown upwards with an initial velocity of $30m/s$. Graph the velocity-time graph for the motion till it falls back to the starting point.

					**Extra Question:** How much distance has the ball travelled?

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.4 MOTION: Free Fall
					* Without air resistance, gravity causes an acceleration of $9.8m/s^2$. 
					* With air resistance:
						* The object falls and its speed increases
						* The faster an object moves, the more air resistance it faces
						* Eventually air resistance and gravity are equal and opposite 
						* No resultant acceleration, so the speed becomes constant
						* This constant speed is known as the **terminal velocity**

					The terminal velocity of a human is around $200km/h$.  
					The terminal velocity of an ant is around $6km/h$.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.4 MOTION: Free Fall
					The terminal velocity of an object depends on the weight, size and shape.  
					* A small dense object has a high terminal velocity
					* A light object with larger area has a low terminal velocity

					<h3>EXTRA: Different ideas of gravity in history</h3>
					<img height="250" src="images/aristotle.jpg"></img>
					<p><b>Aristotle (~400 B.C)</b></p>					
					<blockquote>
					Aristotle thought that heavier objects fell faster than lighter objects.
					<p>Aristotle's explanation of gravity is that all bodies move toward their natural place. According to him, the natural place of water is a concentric shell around the Earth because earth is heavier; it sinks in water.</p>

					<h3>EXTRA: Three different ideas of gravity in history</h3>

					<blockquote>In 628 CE, Brahmagupta was the first to describe gravity as an attractive force, and used the term "gurutvākarṣaṇam" in Sanskrit to describe it.

					<p><b>Galileo Galilei, 1564 – 1642</b></p>

					<h3>2.6 MOTION: Forces in Balance</h3>

				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.7 MOTION: Force, mass, acceleration
					* A force is a push or a pull. It can cause an object at rest to move, or if the body is already moving, it can change its speed or direction of motion.
					* A force can also change a body’s shape or size. For example, a spring (or wire) will stretch when loaded with a weight.

					<h3>2.7 MOTION: Force, mass, acceleration</h3>
					<p>Forces are vectors</p>
					<img height="450" src="images/forces_adding.png"></img>
					<p><b>Note:</b> Any resultant force causes an acceleration in the same direction as the resultant force</p>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.7 MOTION: Force, mass, acceleration
					Newton's three laws of motion are three physical laws that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it. 
					* **First Law:** If a body is at rest or moving at a constant speed in a straight line, it will remain at rest or keep moving in a straight line at constant speed unless it is acted upon by a force. 
						* This resistance to change in velocity is known as **inertia**
					* **Second Law:** Gives a mathematical relationship between force, mass and acceleration
					* **Third Law:** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.7 MOTION: Force, mass, acceleration

					##### Newton's second law of motion
					> The resultant force acting on an object is proportional to the mass of the object and its acceleration.
					> $$ \text{Force} = \text{Mass} \times \text{Acceleration}$$
					> or
					> $$ F = ma$$

					**Question:** The quantity on the LHS has the SI unit Newton, and the quantity on the RHS has SI unit $kg\\; m/s^2$. Does this mean $1 N = 1 kg \\; m/s^2$?

					**Answer:** $1$ Newton is the force required to give a mass of $1$ kilogram an acceleration of $1 m/s^2$.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.7 MOTION: Force, mass, acceleration

					**Workbook 2.7, 1.a.i**  
					Calculate the force exerted on an object if it accelerates at $5m/s^2$ and has a mass of $0.5kg$

					**Workbook 2.7, 1.a.ii**  
					Calculate the acceleratation produced if a force of $3000N$ acts on a car of mass $900kg$

					**Workbook 2.7, 1.a.iii**  
					What is the mass of a boy if he accelerates at $2m/s^2$ when a force of $95N$ acts on him?

					**Workbook 2.7, 1.d (Extension)**  
					A pilot will lose consciouness if he is subjected to accelerations greater than 8 times the acceleration due to gravity (8g). By how much can the speed of his aeroplane increase in $2$ seconds if he is to remain conscious?
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.9 MOTION: Force, weight and gravity
					* Any acceleration has to be caused by a **resultant** force.
					* Every objects accelerates towards the earth at $9.8m/s^2$
					* This acceleration due to gravity is also caused by a force: the **gravitational force**
					* All masses exert a gravitational force on each other
					
					**Question:** What causes the gravitational force?
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.9 MOTION: Force, weight and gravity
					* **Definition:** Weight a gravitational force on an object that has mass
					* **Definition:** Mass is a measure of the quantity of matter in an object

					Wherever you are, your mass remains constant. However your weight on the moon would be 16% of what your weight is on the Earth.

					> $$ \text{Weight} = \text{mass} \times \text{acceleration due to gravity}$$
					> or
					> $$W = mg$$

					**Question:** What is the unit of Weight?

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.9 MOTION: Force, weight and gravity
					* The force of gravity acts through space and causes an object to fall to the ground.
* We try to explain gravity by saying that the Earth is surrounded by a gravitational field which exerts a force on any object in the field.
* The **gravitational field strength** is defined as the force acting per unit mass.
