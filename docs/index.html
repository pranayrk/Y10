					<h3>2.1 MOTION: Speed, velocity and acceleration</h3>
					<img src="images/galileo.webp" height="200"</img>
					<p><b>Galileo Galilei, 1564 â€“ 1642</b></p>
					<blockquote>"... is usually credited with being the first to measure speed by considering the distance covered and the time it takes."</blockquote>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>2.1 MOTION: Speed, velocity and acceleration</h3>

					<blockquote>$\text{average speed} = \displaystyle \frac{\text{distance moved}}{\text{time taken}}$


						<p>or</p>

						$v = \displaystyle \frac{s}{t}$


					</blockquote>
					<p> <b>Speed</b> is a <em>scalar</em> quantity that is a measure of the rate of change of distance.</p>
					<p><b>Unit:</b> If distance is measured in metres and time in seconds, speed is measured in metres per second ($m/s$)</p>

					**Workbook 2.1, 1.b.i**  
					 Calculate the speed of a girl walking if she travels $100m$ in $50s$

					 **Workbook 2.1, 1.b.ii**  
					 Calculate the average speed of a car that travels $2km$ in $2$ minutes

					 **Workbook 2.1, 1.b.iii**  
					 An athlete moving at $4.5m/s$ travels a distance of $0.09km$. How long does this take?

				### 2.1 MOTION: Speed, velocity and acceleration
				* A *scalar* is a quantity which is the answer to the question "how much"
				* A *vector* is a quantity which answers the questions "how much" + "in which direction"
				* **Displacement** is the distance an object travels in a particular direction. 
				* **Velocity** is the speed an object travels in a particular direction.
			
				> $\text{Velocity} = \displaystyle\frac{\text{displacement}}{\text{time taken}}$

	<blockquote>$\text{avg. acceleration} = \displaystyle \frac{\text{change in velocity}}{\text{time taken}}$


						<p>or</p>

						$v = \displaystyle \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$


					</blockquote>

					<b>Acceleration</b> is a <em>vector</em> that is a measure of the rate of change of velocity

					<p><b>Unit:</b> If time is measured in seconds and velocity in metres per second, acceleration has the unit metres per second squared ($m/s^2$)</p>

				### 2.1 MOTION: Speed, velocity and acceleration

				**Workbook 2.2, 1.b**   
				Calculate the acceleration of a cyclist who increases her velocity from $5 m/s$ to $7 m/s$ in $0.5s$

				**Workbook 2.2, 1.c** 

				How long does it take for a train to increase its velocity from $10m/s$ to $40m/s$ if it accelerates at $3 m/s^2$?


				**Workbook 2.2, 1.d**  

				A car, initially travelling at $6 m/s$, accelerates at $4 m/s^2$ for $2.5s$. What is its final velocity?

					**Workbook 2.4, 2 (Extension)**  
					Sketch a velocity time graph for the following journey:
					A girl runs with a constant acceleration of $1.5 m/s^2$ for $3s$. She then runs at a steady speed for $5s$ before decelerating at a decreasing rate for $10s$. Include values of both axes.

					<h3>Extra: Vectors</h3>

					<blockquote>A vector is a quantity having direction as well as magnitude</blockquote>

					<p>The most accurate mental image for a vector is to imagine a directed arrow of a certain size.</p>

					<h3>2.3 MOTION: Recording Motion</h3>
					<h4>For Self Study</h4>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.4 MOTION: Free Fall
					* **Acceleration of free fall** is the *constant* downward acceleration applied on an object which makes it fall down
					* This acceleration is represented by the symbol $g$. 
						* On Earth, the acceleration measures to be $9.8m/s^2$. 
						* On the moon, it is $1.62m/s^2$
						* On Jupiter, it is $24.9m/s^2$
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.4 MOTION: Free Fall
					**Learners Book, 2.5 Page 2**  
					A ball is thrown upwards with an initial velocity of $30m/s$. Graph the velocity-time graph for the motion till it falls back to the starting point.

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.4 MOTION: Free Fall
					* Without air resistance, gravity causes an acceleration of $9.8m/s^2$. 
					* With air resistance:
						* The object falls and its speed increases
						* The faster an object moves, the more air resistance it faces
						* Eventually air resistance and gravity are equal and opposite 
						* No resultant acceleration, so the speed becomes constant
						* This constant speed is known as the **terminal velocity**

					The terminal velocity of a human is around $200km/h$.  
					The terminal velocity of an ant is around $6km/h$.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.4 MOTION: Free Fall
					The terminal velocity of an object depends on the weight, size and shape.  
					* A small dense object have a high terminal velocity
					* A light object with larger area has a low terminal velocity
