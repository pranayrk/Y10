	<h3>5.3: Expanding Solids and Liquids</h3>
	Thermal expansion
According to the kinetic particle model (Topic 2.1.2)

The linear (length) expansion of solids is small
and for the effect to be noticed, the solid must
be long and/or the temperature change must be
large. For a 1 m length of steel it is 0.012 mm for
a 1°C rise in temperature.
The particles in a liquid are further apart, less
ordered and are more mobile than in a solid so
the interaction between the particles is less and
expansion is easier for liquids than for solids.
Liquids typically expand about five times more
than solids for a given temperature rise. In gases,
the interactions between particles are few
because they are far apart and move about very
quickly; this means they are able to expand much
more easily than liquids. Typically, gases expand
about 20 times more than liquids for a given
temperature rise. These figures indicate that
gases expand much more readily than liquids, and
liquids expand more readily than solids.






The temperature of a body tells us how hot the body
is. It is measured using a thermometer usually in
degrees Celsius (0°C).
In the liquid-in-glass thermometer the liquid in
a glass bulb expands up a capillary tube when the
bulb is heated. The liquid must be easily seen and
must expand (or contract) rapidly and by a large
amount over a wide range of temperature. It must
not stick to the inside of the tube or the reading
will be too high when the temperature is falling.
Mercury and coloured alcohol are commonly used
liquids in this type of thermometer. Mercury freezes
at −39°C and boils at 357°C but is a toxic material.
A non-toxic metal alloy substitute for mercury,
such as Galinstan, is often used nowadays; it melts
at −19°C and boils at 1300°C. Alcohol freezes at
−115°C and boils at 78°C and is therefore more
suitable for low temperatures.

	<p>When heated they vibrate faster, so force each other a little further apart and expansion results.</p>

	<p>If equal lengths of two different metals, such as copper and iron, are riveted together so that they cannot move separately, they form a <b>bimetallic strip</b></p>

	<p>When the iron reaches the required temperature the strip bends down, breaks the circuit at the contacts and switches off the heater.<p>

	<p>Between 4°C and 0°C water surprisingly expands.</p>
	<p>At 0°C, when it freezes, volume expansion occurs and every $100\; cm^3$ of water becomes $109\; cm^3$ of ice.</p>

	* We can observe $p$ is directly proportional to $\frac{1}{V}$ (since the graph is a straight line)
	* So, $p$ is inversely proportional to $V$.
	$$p \propto \frac{1}{V}$$

	* Changing the proportionality to an equality:
	$$ p = \text{constant} \times \frac{1}{V}$$
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	> $$ p \times V = \text{constant}$$

	* If several pairs of readings, $p_1$ and $V_1$, $p_2$ and $V_2$, etc. are taken, then it can be confirmed that

	$$ p_1 V_1 = p_2 V_2 = \text{constant}$$

	> **The pressure of a fixed mass of gas is inversely proportional to its volume if its temperature is kept constant**

	Kinetic model of matter on gas pressure

	All the particles in a gas are in rapid random
motion, with a wide range of speeds, and repeatedly
hit and rebound from the surfaces of the container
in huge numbers per second.
This causes a pressure on the surfaces of the
container. When the temperature of the gas rises,
so does the average speed and kinetic energy of
the particles. Collisions with the surfaces of the
container occur more frequently and so the pressure
of the gas increases.
</section>
<section>
	Force and gas pressure
At each collision of a gas particle with a surface
of the container, it undergoes a change of
momentum which produces a force on the surface
(see Topic 1.6). At a constant temperature the
average force and hence the pressure exerted on
the surface is constant, since pressure is force
per unit area. When the temperature rises and the
rate at which collisions with the surfaces of the
container increases, so does the average force and
hence the gas pressure.
