	### 5.1: Moving Particles 
	* The **Kinetic theory of matter** says that matter is made of tiny particles constantly in motion
	* Particles have kinetic energy because they are moving or vibrating
		* In solids, particles vibrate about their fixed  positions
		* In liquids, particles vibrate a little and also move around a little
		* In gases, particles move around a lot

	<blockquote>Movement should not be denied based on the fact it is not seen. Who would deny that the leaves of trees move when rustled by a wind, despite it being unobservable from large distances? Just as in this case motion remains hidden due to perspective, it remains hidden in warm bodies due to the extremely small sizes of the moving particles. In both cases, the viewing angle is so small that neither the object nor their movement can be seen.</blockquote>

	### 5.2: Temperature

	> We have an intuitive concept of temperature as the ‘coldness’ or ‘hotness’ of a body, but it wasn’t until the 19th century that one of the greatest discoveries in physics related the concept of temperature to the random motion of molecules.


	* The nature of **heat** can be explained by considering particles of solids and liquids are in constant motion.
	* When heated they vibrate faster, so force each other a little further apart
	* Kinetic theory uses the idea that as particles heat up **they gain more kinetic energy and move faster**.

	> Temperature is proportional to the average random kinetic energy of the molecules.

</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 5.2: Temperature
	* Temperature can be measured with a thermometer, which is simply a device that has one property that changes in a predictable way as temperature changes. 
	* That property is volume in liquid-in-glass thermometers
		* the liquid column changes its volume
		* the length then changes since the cross-sectional area stays the same
	* Properties other than volume can be used, for example, electrical resistance.

<section data-markdown>
	### 5.2: Temperature

	* All matter has internal energy. This is an **energy store** and we measure it to find the **temperature** of an object.
	* Energy is transferred from an object of higher temperature to an object of lower temperature. 
		* This is known as **thermal interaction**
	* **Thermal equilibrium** describes a state where two or more objects have the same temperature and there is no net transfer of energy between them.
	* **Heat** is energy that is transferred from one body to another as a result of a difference in temperature.
		* Heat is **thermal energy** and is measured in Joules
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 5.2: Temperature
	* When a thermometer is used to measure the temperature of a body it has to come into contact with the body.
	* A **thermal interaction** takes place and energy is transferred until the thermometer and the body are at the same temperature.
	* The thermal energy causes the particles of the mercury to move away from each other and the mercury will expand
	* Once all the particles reach the same average internal energy, the mercury and the object are at **thermal equilibrium**.

	<h3>5.3: Expanding Solids and Liquids</h3>
	Thermal expansion
According to the kinetic particle model (Topic 2.1.2)
the particles of solids and liquids are in constant
vibration. When heated they vibrate faster, so force
each other a little further apart and expansion
results.

The linear (length) expansion of solids is small
and for the effect to be noticed, the solid must
be long and/or the temperature change must be
large. For a 1 m length of steel it is 0.012 mm for
a 1°C rise in temperature.
The particles in a liquid are further apart, less
ordered and are more mobile than in a solid so
the interaction between the particles is less and
expansion is easier for liquids than for solids.
Liquids typically expand about five times more
than solids for a given temperature rise. In gases,
the interactions between particles are few
because they are far apart and move about very
quickly; this means they are able to expand much
more easily than liquids. Typically, gases expand
about 20 times more than liquids for a given
temperature rise. These figures indicate that
gases expand much more readily than liquids, and
liquids expand more readily than solids.

Axles and gear wheels are major components of
clocks on the small scale and wheeled vehicles from
cars to trains on the large scale.
In Figure 2.2.1 the axles have been shrunk by
cooling in liquid nitrogen at −196°C until the gear
wheels can be slipped on to them. On regaining normal
temperature, the axles expand to give a very tight fit.

If equal lengths of two different metals, such as
copper and iron, are riveted together so that they
cannot move separately, they form a bimetallic strip
(Figure 2.2.2a). When heated, copper expands more
than iron and to allow this the strip bends with copper
on the outside (Figure 2.2.2b). If they had expanded
equally, the strip would have stayed straight.

Heat from the fire makes the bimetallic strip bend
and complete the electrical circuit, so ringing the
alarm bell (Figure 2.2.3a).
A bimetallic strip is also used in this way to work
the flashing direction indicator lamps in a car, being
warmed by an electric heating coil wound round it.

A thermostat keeps the temperature of a room or an
appliance constant. The one in Figure 2.2.3b uses a
bimetallic strip in the electrical heating circuit of,
for example, an iron.
When the iron reaches the required temperature
the strip bends down, breaks the circuit at the

contacts and switches off the heater. After cooling
a little, the strip remakes contact and turns the
heater on again. A near-steady temperature results.
If the control knob is screwed down, the strip has
to bend more to break the heating circuit and this
requires a higher temperature.

In general, when matter is heated it expands and
when cooled it contracts. If the changes are resisted
large forces are created, which are sometimes useful
but at other times are a nuisance.
Gaps used to be left between lengths of railway
lines to allow for expansion in summer. They caused
a familiar ‘clickety-click’ sound as the train passed
over them. These days rails are welded into lengths
of about 1 km and are held by concrete ‘sleepers’
that can withstand the large forces created without
buckling. Also, at the joints the ends are tapered
and overlap (Figure 2.2.4a). This gives a smoother
journey and allows some expansion near the ends of
each length of rail.
For similar reasons slight gaps are left between
lengths of aluminium guttering. In central heating
pipes ‘expansion joints’ are used to join lengths of pipe
(Figure 2.2.4b); these allow the copper pipes to expand
in length inside the joints when carrying very hot water.

As water is cooled to 4°C it contracts, as we would
expect. However, between 4°C and 0°C it expands,
surprisingly. Water has a maximum density at 4°C

At 0°C, when it freezes, a considerable volume
expansion occurs and every 100 cm3 of water becomes
109 cm3 of ice. This accounts for the bursting of
unlagged water pipes in very cold weather and for
the fact that ice is less dense than cold water and so
floats. Figure 2.2.7 shows a bottle of frozen milk,
the main constituent of which is water.


The temperature of a body tells us how hot the body
is. It is measured using a thermometer usually in
degrees Celsius (0°C).
In the liquid-in-glass thermometer the liquid in
a glass bulb expands up a capillary tube when the
bulb is heated. The liquid must be easily seen and
must expand (or contract) rapidly and by a large
amount over a wide range of temperature. It must
not stick to the inside of the tube or the reading
will be too high when the temperature is falling.
Mercury and coloured alcohol are commonly used
liquids in this type of thermometer. Mercury freezes
at −39°C and boils at 357°C but is a toxic material.
A non-toxic metal alloy substitute for mercury,
such as Galinstan, is often used nowadays; it melts
at −19°C and boils at 1300°C. Alcohol freezes at
−115°C and boils at 78°C and is therefore more
suitable for low temperatures.
