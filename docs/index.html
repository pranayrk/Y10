	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5raMmc7BeEY">Ripple Tank showing superposition, constructive and destructive interference</a></p>
	<h6>
		<b>Superposition</b> refers to the principle that when two or more waves overlap at a point, the resulting disturbance at that point is the sum of the individual disturbances each wave would produce on its own. This means the waves effectively "add up" when they intersect. 

		This property applies to various types of waves like water waves, sound waves, and light waves.

	<ul>
		<li><b>Sound</b> is produced by vibrating sources placed in a <em>medium</em>. The medium is usually air, but it can be any gas, liquid or solid.</li>
		<li>In a sound wave, the air molecules move repeatedly closer together and then further apart in the direction of travel of the wave.</li>
	</ul>

	<h6>The speaker has a cone which is made to vibrate in and out by an electric current. When the cone moves out, the air in front is compressed; when it moves in, the air is rarefied (becomes ‘thinner’). The wave progresses through the air but the air as a whole does not move. The air particles (molecules) vibrate backwards and forwards a little as the wave passes. When the wave enters your ear the compressions and rarefactions cause small, rapid pressure changes on the eardrum and you experience the sensation of sound.</h6>

	<ul>
		<li><em>Sound is a longitudinal wave</em>, the direction of vibration of air molecules is parallel to the direction in which the wave travels.</li>

		<li>Like all longitudinal waves, sound waves propagate as a series of compressions (C) and rarefactions (R).
			<ul>
				<li><b>Compressions</b> are regions where air pressure is higher than the surrounding air pressure.</li>

	<h5>Direct Method to measure the speed of sound</h5>

	<p>The speed of sound in air can be found directly by measuring the time $t$ taken for a sound to travel past two microphones separated by a distance $d$.</p>

	<h6>
		An estimate of the speed of sound in air can be made directly if you stand about 100 metres from a high wall or building and clap your hands. Echoes are produced. When the clapping rate is such that each clap coincides with the echo of the previous one, the sound has travelled to the wall and back in the time between two claps, call this one interval. By timing 30 intervals with a stopwatch, the time $t$ for one interval can be found. Also, knowing the distance d to the wall, a rough value of the speed of sound is obtained.
