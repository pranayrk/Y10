				* A *scalar* is a quantity which is the answer to the question "how much"
				* A *vector* is a quantity which answers the questions "how much" + "in which direction"
				* **Displacement** is the distance an object travels in a particular direction.

					<h3>2.3 : Recording Motion</h3>
					<h4>For Self Study</h4>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.4 : Free Fall
					* **Acceleration of free fall** is the *constant* downward acceleration applied on an object which makes it fall down
					* This acceleration is represented by the symbol $g$. 
						* On Earth, the acceleration measures to be $9.8m/s^2$. 
						* On the moon, it is $1.62m/s^2$
						* On Jupiter, it is $24.9m/s^2$
				</section>

					### 2.4 : Free Fall
					**Learners Book, 2.5 Page 2**  
					A ball is thrown upwards with an initial velocity of $30m/s$. Graph the velocity-time graph for the motion till it falls back to the starting point.

					**Extra Question:** How much distance has the ball travelled?

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.4 : Free Fall
					* Without air resistance, gravity causes an acceleration of $9.8m/s^2$. 
					* With air resistance:
						* The object falls and its speed increases
						* The faster an object moves, the more air resistance it faces
						* Eventually air resistance and gravity are equal and opposite 
						* No resultant acceleration, so the speed becomes constant
						* This constant speed is known as the **terminal velocity**
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.4 : Free Fall

					The terminal velocity of a human is around $200km/h$.  
					The terminal velocity of an ant is around $6km/h$.

					The terminal velocity of an object depends on the weight, size and shape:
					* A small dense object has a high terminal velocity
					* A light object with larger area has a low terminal velocity

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.7 : Force, mass, acceleration
					* A force is a push or a pull. 
					* It can cause an object at rest to move, or if the body is already moving, it can change its speed or direction of motion.
					* A force can also change a body’s shape or size. 
					* For example: a spring or wire will stretch when loaded with a weight.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>2.7 : Force, mass, acceleration</h3>
					<p>Forces are vectors</p>
					<img height="350" src="images/forces_adding.png"></img>
					<p><b>Important:</b> Any resultant force causes an acceleration in the same direction as the resultant force</p>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.7 : Force, mass, acceleration
					Newton's three laws of motion are three physical laws that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it. 
					* **First Law:** the velocity of a body does not want to change
					* **Second Law:** Gives a mathematical relationship between force, mass and acceleration
					* **Third Law:** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

					Newton's Laws of Motion govern the motion of everything from molecules to planets.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.7 : Force, mass, acceleration
					##### Newton's first law of motion
					> **Statement:** An object stays at rest, or continues to move in a straight line at constant speed, unless acted on by a resultant force.

					All matter has a built-in opposition to any change in its velocity.

					This property of matter is called **inertia**.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.7 : Force, mass, acceleration

					##### Newton's second law of motion
					> $$ \text{Resultant Force} = \text{Mass} \times \text{Acceleration}$$
					> or
					> $$ F = ma$$

					The $1$ Newton is the force required to give a mass of $1$ kilogram an acceleration of $1 \\;m/s^2$.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.7 : Force, mass, acceleration

					**Workbook 2.7, 1.a.i**  
					Calculate the force exerted on an object if it accelerates at $5m/s^2$ and has a mass of $0.5kg$

					**Workbook 2.7, 1.a.ii**  
					Calculate the acceleratation produced if a force of $3000N$ acts on a car of mass $900kg$

					**Workbook 2.7, 1.a.iii**  
					What is the mass of a boy if he accelerates at $2m/s^2$ when a force of $95N$ acts on him?
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.9 : Force, weight and gravity
					* Any acceleration has to be caused by a **resultant** force.
					* Every objects accelerates towards the earth at $9.8m/s^2$
					* This acceleration due to gravity is also caused by a force: the **gravitational force**
					* All objects exert a gravitational force on each other
					
					**Question:** What causes the gravitational force? 

					**Answer:** No one knows. Newton described the concept of some force acting upon another at a distance as a "philosophical absurdity". In some ways, his description is accurate even today, since we do not have a proven cause for gravity.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.9 : Force, weight and gravity

					* **Definition:** **Mass** is a measure of the quantity of matter in an object.
					* **Definition:** **Weight** a gravitational force on an object that has mass

					**Note:** The SI unit of weight is Newton ($N$) since it is a force

					**Important:** Wherever an object is, its mass remains constant.   
					The weight of an object varies on how much gravitational force acts on it.

					> $$ \text{Weight} = \text{mass} \times \text{acceleration due to gravity}$$
					> or
					> $$W = mg$$


				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.9 : Force, weight and gravity
					* The force of gravity acts through space and causes an object to fall to the ground.
					* A **field** is a region in space where an object experiences some force.
					* We try to explain gravity by saying that the Earth is surrounded by a gravitational field
					* The **gravitational field strength** is defined as the gravitational force acting per unit mass.

					### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum
					* **Momentum** can be defined as how much motion is contained in a mass.
					* If an object is moving, then it has momentum.
					* It is a measure of how much "motion" is there within an object.
					* Momentum is a useful quantity to consider when bodies are involved in collisions or explosions.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum
					##### Difference between force and momentum

					**Force:**

					* Force represents *external* action upon a body, whether a pulling or pushing action. 
					* Force always involves *two bodies*, each applying a force on the other.
					* There cannot be force without an acceleration.
					
					**Momentum:**
					* Momentum is the representation of the amount of motion within a *single* object.
					* Momentum can exist *without* any acceleration (if the object is at constant velocity)

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum
					> $$ \text{momentum} = \text{mass} \times \text{velocity}$$
					> or  
					> $$p = mv$$

					**Question:** Is momentum a scalar or a vector?  
					**Answer:** Momentum is a vector since it involves velocity

					**Question:** What is the SI unit of momentum?  
					**Answer:** The SI Unit of momentum is $kg \\; m/s$

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum
					##### Newton's Second Law of motion (version 2)

					> * A resultant force causes a body to accelerate.
					> * Any acceleration causes the velocity to change
					> * Any change in velocity causes momentum to change

					* From the above three points, we can conclude that any resultant force causes a change in momentum over time.
					* Newton used this observation to come up with the equation for his second law of motion.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum
					##### Newton's Second Law of motion (version 2)

					> $$ \text{resultant force} = \frac{\text{change in momentum}}{\text{time}}$$
					> or 
					> $$ F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$$

					Newton’s second law in the form $F = ma$ can only be used with constant masses moving in straight lines. 

					If the mass is changing we need to use the law in the form $F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$ 
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum

					**Question:** Why is $F = ma$ the same as $ F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$?
					$$ 
					\begin{aligned}
					F = ma \implies F & = m \times \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}  \\\\
					\implies F & = m \times \frac{(\text{final velocity} - \text{initial velocity})}{\Delta t} \\\\
					\implies F & = \frac{(m \times \text{final velocity} - m \times \text{initial velocity})}{\Delta t} \\\\
					\implies F & = \frac{(\text{final momentum} - \text{initial momentum})}{\Delta t} \\\\
					\implies F & = \frac{\text{change in momentum}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} \\\\
					\end{aligned}
					$$

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum
					The equation $ F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} $ can be rearranged as

					> $$\text{resultant force} \times \text{time} = \text{change in momentum}$$  
					> or
					> $$F \times \Delta t = \Delta p$$
					* The quantity $F \times \Delta t$ is known as **impulse**
					* $F \times \Delta t = \Delta p\\;\\;$ is known as the **impulse-momentum** equation

					**Note:** The SI unit of impulse is $N s$
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum
					* $F \times \Delta t = \Delta p$ talks about *how much force over how much time* is required to cause a given change in momentum
					* For example, consider we want to stop a moving car. To get this effect: 
						* We can use the brakes to stop the car quickly. This is a large force applied over a short time
						* We can also let the car slow down naturally by friction. This is a small force applied over a long time.

					**Question:** Why do seatbelts and airbags work?  
					**Answer:** Seatbelts and airbags distribute the impulse over a longer time resulting in less force applied to the person.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum
					**Workbook 2.10, 1.b.i**    
					What is the momentum of a $1000kg$ car moving at $20m/s$?

					A force of $25N$ acts on a $30kg$ shopping trolley for $1.5s$. What is the velocity of the trolley if it was originally at rest?
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum
					* In a closed system, the total momentum before an event is the same as the total momentum after the event

					* More accurately,
					> When two or more bodies act on one another, as in a collision, the total momentum of the bodies remains constant, provided no external forces act on them.

					* This statement is known as the **law of conservation of momentum**

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum

					**Question:** A truck weighing $4500kg$ and travelling at $12m/s$ collides with a car weighing $1200kg$ travelling in the opposite direction at $25m/s$. After the collision, they both stick together as one object.

					Find their velocity after the collision.

					**Question:** A gun weighing $2kg$ is fired. The bullet weighing $5g$ shoots out at $120m/s$. Find the recoil velocity of the gun.

					**Workbook 2.11, 3**  
					A car travelling at $10m/s$ collides with another identical car travelling at $4m/s$ in the same direction. The two vehicles stick together on impact. What is their new velocity?
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.10: Action and Reaction
					##### Newton's Third Law

					* **Informally:** Newton's third law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. 
					* The *action* and *reaction* refer to forces
					* **Formally:** If Object A exerts a force on Object B, then Object B exerts an equal amount of force on Object A in the opposite direction. 
					> This law represents the fact that all forces occur in pairs. For example, it is not possible to push an object unless it pushes back on you.

					### Examples of Forces
					##### Non-Contact Forces
					* **Gravitational:** The pull exerted by gravity on any object
					* **Electrostatic:** The attractive or repulsive forces between electric charges
					* **Magnetic:** The attractive or repulsive force between magnets
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Examples of Forces
					##### Contact Forces
					* **Normal Force:** The push exerted by a surface on an object pressing on it.
					* **Tension:** The pull exerted by a stretched spring, string or rope on an object attached to it.
					* **Compression:** A force that squeezes something together
					* **Friction:** The force that opposes motion between surfaces in contact
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Different Types of Forces</h3>
					<h5>Normal Force</h5>
					<img height="350" src="images/forces_and_resultants.png"></img>
					<p>The normal force is the force that surfaces exert to prevent solid objects from passing through each other.</p>
					<p><b>Note:</b> The normal force is always perpendicular to the surface</p>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Different Types of Forces
					##### Normal Force
					**Q.** A $4.5\\;kg$ package of bubble gum is being delivered to the top floor of an office building. 

					The box sits on the floor of an elevator which accelerates upward with an acceleration of magnitude of $3.0\\;m/s^2$. 
					The delivery person is also resting one foot on the package exerting a downward force on the package of magnitude $5\\;N$.

					What is the normal force on the package exerted by the floor of the elevator?
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.8: Friction

					* **Solid friction** is a force which opposes motion between surfaces in contact.
					* The amount of friction between two surfaces depends on:
						* the material of the surfaces 
						* the roughness of the surfaces
						* the normal force acting between them. 
					* In general, frictional forces can be unpredictable.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.8: Friction

					* Before any movement occurs, the friction force is called **static friction**. 
						* The static frictional force varies up to an upper limit just before motion begins.
					* After motion has started the friction is called **dynamic friction**. 
					* Dynamic friction is independent of speed.
					* Dynamic Friction results in heating. 

					**Important:** Static Friction is greater than dynamic friction.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.8: Friction

					The elementary property of dynamic friction were discovered by experiment in the 15th-18th centuries and were expressed as three empirical laws:

					* **Amontons' First Law:** The force of friction is directly proportional to the applied load. 
					* **Amontons' Second Law:** The force of friction is independent of the apparent area of contact.
					* **Coulomb's Law of Friction:** Dynamic friction is independent of the sliding velocity.

					**Question:** What is the cause of friction?
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.8: Friction

					* When an object moves through a gas or liquid, there is a friction force opposing the motion. 
					* **In liquid:** this frictional force is called **drag** 
					* **In air:** The frictional force is called **air resistance**.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>2.8: Friction</h3>
					<p><b>Question:</b> A person is pushing a $1.0\;kg$ box across a table with a downward diagonal force $F_A = 10\;N$ at an angle of $30^\circ$ as seen below. If the box does not move:

					### 3.4: Stretching and Compressing
					* Forces can change the size and shape of a body if the body is **elastic**
					* **Examples:** a spring or a band of rubber stretches with increasing load
					* The **extension** is defined as the change in length of the object being stretched.
					* Load-Extension graphs help us understand how much force on the object causes how much extension.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>3.4: Stretching and Compressing</h3>
					<img height="600" src="images/measuring_the_spring_constant.png"></img>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 3.4: Stretching and Compressing
					* For some materials, the load–extension graph is a straight-line graph through the origin. 
					* This means the load is directly proportional to the extension (linear)
					* This means doubling the force, doubles the extension. 
					* Not all load–extension graphs are linear
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 3.4: Stretching and Compressing

					* For a spring, the graph is linear until a certain point. This point is known as the **limit of proportionality**
					* The point at which the material stop behaving elastically is known as the **elastic limit**
					* **Hooke's Law:** A material is said to obey Hooke's Law if its extension is proportional to the load (below its elastic limit)
					* Springs and metal wires obey Hooke's Law. Rubber bands do not.

				### 2.14: Moving in Circles

				* **Newton’s first law of motion:** An object will stay at rest or continue to move at constant velocity unless acted on by a resultant force.
				
				* Therefore, any object that is not moving in a constant velocity must have a resultant force on it.
				* When an object is moving in a circle, its velocity keeps changing.
				* The resultant force that causes the object to move in a circle is known as **centripetal force**

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
				### 2.14: Moving in Circles

				> Any centripetal force must continuously change direction so that it is always directed towards the centre of the circle. 

				* Centripetal forces always act perpendicularly to the direction of instantaneous velocity.

				or 

				* When resultant force is perpendicular to the direction of motion, the object follows a circular path.

				##### Examples of centripetal force
				* **Tension** on an object which is spun around on the end of a length of string.
				* **Friction** for people or cars moving on curved roads.
				* **Gravitational forces**for satellites moving around the Earth
				* **Electrical forces** that keep electrons moving around nuclei in atoms.
				* **Magnetic forces** which maintain particle beams in circular paths in nuclear accelerators.

				**Question:** What provides the centripetal force for these athletes running on a curved track? What design features make sure that this force can be large enough for high speeds?
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
				### 2.14: Moving in Circles

				The resultant force required to keep the object moving in a circle varies with speed and mass of the object, and the radius of the circle.
				* Increasing the speed $\implies$ more force required
				* Increasing radius $\implies$ less force required
				* Increasing mass $\implies$ more force required

				### 2.14: Moving in Circles

				* Many people identify a force acting outwards on them when they go around a circle
				* This force is often called **centrifugal force**.
				
				> Centrifugal force is *normally thought of* as the tendency of an object moving in a circle to travel away from the center of a circle.

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
				### 2.14: Moving in Circles
				##### Example of centrifugal force

				A passenger may feel that they are forced outwards against the side door of a car going quickly around a corner. 

				* **From the passenger's perspective:** this is sort of correct
				* **More correct perspective:** the car door is pushing inwards on the passenger, making them move around a corner.

				> Centrifugal force is a *fictitious* force, i.e. it does not really exist.
