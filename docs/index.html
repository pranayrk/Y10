					<h4>For Self Study</h4>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.4 : Free Fall
					* **Acceleration of free fall** is the *constant* downward acceleration applied on an object which makes it fall down
					* This acceleration is represented by the symbol $g$. 
						* On Earth, the acceleration measures to be $9.8m/s^2$. 
						* On the moon, it is $1.62m/s^2$
						* On Jupiter, it is $24.9m/s^2$

					### 2.4 : Free Fall
					**Learners Book, 2.5 Page 2**  
					A ball is thrown upwards with an initial velocity of $30m/s$. Graph the velocity-time graph for the motion till it falls back to the starting point.

					**Extra Question:** How much distance has the ball travelled?

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.4 : Free Fall
					* Without air resistance, gravity causes an acceleration of $9.8m/s^2$. 
					* With air resistance:
						* The object falls and its speed increases
						* The faster an object moves, the more air resistance it faces
						* Eventually air resistance and gravity are equal and opposite 
						* No resultant acceleration, so the speed becomes constant
						* This constant speed is known as the **terminal velocity**

					The terminal velocity of a human is around $200km/h$.  
					The terminal velocity of an ant is around $6km/h$.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.4 : Free Fall
					The terminal velocity of an object depends on the weight, size and shape.  
					* A small dense object has a high terminal velocity
					* A light object with larger area has a low terminal velocity

					### 2.7 : Force, mass, acceleration
					* A force is a push or a pull. It can cause an object at rest to move, or if the body is already moving, it can change its speed or direction of motion.
					* A force can also change a body’s shape or size. For example, a spring (or wire) will stretch when loaded with a weight.

					### 2.7 : Force, mass, acceleration
					Newton's three laws of motion are three physical laws that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it. 
					* **First Law:** the velocity of a body does not want to change
					* **Second Law:** Gives a mathematical relationship between force, mass and acceleration
					* **Third Law:** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

					Newton's Laws of Motion govern the motion of everything from molecules to planets.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.7 : Force, mass, acceleration
					##### Newton's first law of motion
					> An object stays at rest, or continues to move in a straight line at constant speed, unless acted on by a resultant force.

					All matter has a built-in opposition to any change in its velocity.

					This property of matter is called **inertia** (from the Latin word for laziness).
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.7 : Force, mass, acceleration

					##### Newton's second law of motion
					> The **resultant** force acting on an object is proportional to the mass of the object and its acceleration.
					> $$ \text{Resultant Force} = \text{Mass} \times \text{Acceleration}$$
					> or
					> $$ F = ma$$

					**Question:** Can we say that $1 N = 1 kg \\; m/s^2$?

					**Answer:** The full meaning is that $1$ Newton is the force required to give a mass of $1$ kilogram an acceleration of $1 m/s^2$.

					### 2.9 : Force, weight and gravity
					* Any acceleration has to be caused by a **resultant** force.
					* Every objects accelerates towards the earth at $9.8m/s^2$
					* This acceleration due to gravity is also caused by a force: the **gravitational force**
					* All objects exert a gravitational force on each other
					
					**Question:** What causes the gravitational force? 

					**Answer:** No one knows. Newton described the concept of some force acting upon another at a distance as a "philosophical absurdity". In some ways, his description is accurate even today, since we do not have a proven cause for gravity.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### EXTRA: Newton's law of universal gravitation

					All objects exert a gravitational force on each other

					> $$ \text{Force of Gravity } F = G \frac{m_1 \times m_2}{r^2}$$
					> where
					> G is the constant $\\;\\;6.6 \times 10^{-11}$

					This is the gravitational force between two objects even when they are stationary.

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.9 : Force, weight and gravity
					* **Definition:** **Mass** is a measure of the quantity of matter in an object.
					* **Definition:** **Weight** a gravitational force on an object that has mass

					**Important:** Wherever an object is, its mass remains constant.   
					The weight of an object varies on how much gravitational force acts on it.

					> $$ \text{Weight} = \text{mass} \times \text{acceleration due to gravity}$$
					> or
					> $$W = mg$$

					**Note:** The SI unit of weight is Newton ($N$) since it is a force

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.9 : Force, weight and gravity
					* The force of gravity acts through space and causes an object to fall to the ground.
* We try to explain gravity by saying that the Earth is surrounded by a gravitational field
* The **gravitational field strength** is defined as the force acting per unit mass.

					### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum
					* Momentum can be defined as "mass in motion". If an object is moving, then it has momentum.
					* It is a measure of how much "motion" is there within an object.
					* Momentum is a useful quantity to consider when bodies are involved in collisions or explosions.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum

					##### Difference between force and momentum
					* Force represents external action upon a body, whether a pulling or pushing action. 
					* Force always involves two bodies, each applying a force on the other.
					* Momentum is the representation of the amount of motion within a single object.
					* Momentum can exist without any acceleration.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum
					> $$ \text{momentum} = \text{mass} \times \text{velocity}$$
					> or  
					> $$p = mv$$

					**Question:** Is momentum a scalar or a vector?  
					**Answer:** Momentum is a vector since it involves velocity

					**Question:** What is the SI unit of momentum?  
					**Answer:** The SI Unit of momentum is $kg \\; m/s$

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum
					##### Newton's Second Law of motion (version 2)

					> * A resultant force causes a body to accelerate.
					> * Any acceleration causes the velocity to change
					> * Any change in velocity causes momentum to change

					* From the above three points, we can conclude that any resultant force causes a change in momentum over time.
					* Newton used this observation to come up with the equation for his second law of motion.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum
					##### Newton's Second Law of motion (version 2)

					> $$ \text{resultant force} = \frac{\text{change in momentum}}{\text{time}}$$
					> or 
					> $$ F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$$

					Newton’s second law in the form $F = ma$ can only be used with constant masses moving in straight lines. 

					If the mass is changing we need to use the law in the form $F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$ 
					  

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum

					**Question:** Why is $F = ma$ the same as $ F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$?

					**Answer:** 

					$$ 
					\begin{aligned}
					F = ma \implies F & = m \times \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}  \\\\
					\implies F & = m \times \frac{(\text{final velocity} - \text{initial velocity})}{\Delta t} \\\\
					\implies F & = \frac{(m \times \text{final velocity} - m \times \text{initial velocity})}{\Delta t} \\\\
					\implies F & = \frac{(\text{final momentum} - \text{initial momentum})}{\Delta t} \\\\
					\implies F & = \frac{\text{change in momentum}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} \\\\
					\end{aligned}
					$$

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum
					The equation $ F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} $ can be rearranged as

					> $$\text{resultant force} \times \text{time} = \text{change in momentum}$$  
					> or
					> $$F \times \Delta t = \Delta p$$
					* The quantity $F \times \Delta t$ is known as **impulse**
					* $F \times \Delta t = \Delta p\\;\\;$ is known as the **impulse-momentum** equation

					**Note:** The SI unit of impulse is $N s$
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum
					* $F \times \Delta t = \Delta p$ talks about *how much force over how much time* is required to cause a given change in momentum
					* For example, consider we want to stop a moving car. To get this effect: 
						* We can use the brakes to stop the car quickly. This is a large force applied over a short time
						* We can also let the car slow down naturally by friction. This is a small force applied over a long time.

					**Question:** Why do seatbelts and airbags work?  
					**Answer:** Seatbelts and airbags distribute the impulse over a longer time resulting in less force applied to the person.
				</section>

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.11, 2.12: Momentum
					* In a closed system, the total momentum before an event is the same as the total momentum after the event

					* More accurately,
					> When two or more bodies act on one another, as in a collision, the total momentum of the bodies remains constant, provided no external forces act on them.

					* This statement is known as the **law of conservation of momentum**

				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.10: Action and Reaction
					##### Newton's Third Law

					* **Informally:** Newton's third law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. 
					* The *action* and *reaction* refer to forces
					* **Formally:** If Object A exerts a force on Object B, then Object B exerts an equal amount of force on Object A in the opposite direction. 
					> This law represents the fact that all forces occur in pairs. For example, it is not possible to push an object unless it pushes back on you.

					<h3>Different Types of Forces</h3>
					<h5>Normal Force</h5>
					<img height="350" src="images/forces_and_resultants.png"></img>
					<p>The normal force is the force that surfaces exert to prevent solid objects from passing through each other.</p>
					<p><b>Note:</b> The normal force is always perpendicular to the surface</p>

					### Different Types of Forces
					##### Normal Force
					**Q.** A $4.5\\;kg$ package of bubble gum is being delivered to the top floor of an office building. 

					The box sits on the floor of an elevator which accelerates upward with an acceleration of magnitude of $3.0\\;m/s^2$. 
					The delivery person is also resting one foot on the package exerting a downward force on the package of magnitude $5\\;N$.

					What is the normal force on the package exerted by the floor of the elevator?

					### 3.3: Tension
					* Forces can change the size and shape of a body if the body is **elastic**
					* **Examples:** a spring or a band of rubber stretches with increasing load
					* The **extension** is defined as the change in length of the object being stretched.
					* Load-Extension graphs help us understand how much force on the object causes how much extension.
				</section>
				<section>
					### 3.3: Tension
					* For some materials, the load–extension graph is a straight-line graph through the origin. 
					* This means the load is directly proportional to the extension. 
					* This means doubling the force, doubles the extension. 
					* Not all load–extension graphs are linear, which means the force required to stretch the material changes as the material is stretched.

					Provided that a spring is not overstretched its extension, Δx, (length –
original length) is proportional to the force, F (Hooke’s law).
The stiffness of the spring is represented by the gradient of the graph.
This is often called the force constant, k, of the spring. k = Δ F
Δx
(k = 8.0 = 20 N cm−1 in the graph in Figure 2.23).

					### 2.8: Friction

					* **Solid friction** is a force which opposes motion between surfaces in contact.
					* The amount of friction between two surfaces depends on:
						* the material of the surfaces 
						* the roughness of the surfaces
						* the normal force acting between them. 
					* If more masses are added the frictional forces will increase.
					* In general, frictional forces can be unpredictable.

					**Question:** What is the cause of friction?
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.8 Friction

					* When an object moves through a gas or liquid, there is a friction force opposing the motion. 
					* This friction force in liquid is called drag and in air is called air resistance.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 2.8 Friction

					* Before any movement occurs, we refer to static friction. 
						* The static frictional force varies up to an upper limit just before motion begins.
					* After motion has started the friction is called **dynamic friction**. 
					* Dynamic friction is independent of speed.
					* Dynamic Friction results in heating. 

					**Important:** Static Friction is greater than dynamic friction.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					* A common method for determining a coefficient of static friction involves placing an object on an inclined plane and increasing the angle, θ, until the object just begins to slip. At that point μs = tan θ.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					The elementary property of sliding (kinetic) friction were discovered by experiment in the 15th to 18th centuries and were expressed as three empirical laws:

    Amontons' First Law: The force of friction is directly proportional to the applied load.
    Amontons' Second Law: The force of friction is independent of the apparent area of contact.
    Coulomb's Law of Friction: Dynamic friction is independent of the sliding velocity.
				</section>

					### Da vinci

					> In his notebooks, Leonardo first stated the 'laws' of sliding friction in 1493. His inspiration for investigating friction came about in part from his study of perpetual motion, which he correctly concluded was not possible.
